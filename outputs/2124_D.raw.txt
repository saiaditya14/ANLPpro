You can perform an operation any number of times. The operation consists of:\n1.  Selecting a contiguous subarray `a[l...r]` of the current array with length at least `k`.\n2.  Finding the k-th smallest element `x` in this subarray.\n3.  Choosing an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` where `a[i] == x` and deleting `a[i]` from the array.\n\nThe goal is to determine if it's possible to transform the array into a palindrome. An empty array is considered a palindrome.\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   `1 <= t <= 10^4` (number of test cases)\n*   `1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`\n*   `1 <= a_i <= n`\n*   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.\n\n**Input Format:**\n*   The first line contains `t`, the number of test cases.\n*   For each test case:\n    *   The first line contains `n` and `k`.\n    *   The second line contains `n` integers representing the array `a`.\n\n**Output Format:**\n*   For each test case, output \"YES\" if the array can be made into a palindrome, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n**Example:**\nThe screenshot provides several test cases in the input, which are helpful for testing the solution logic.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe problem asks if we can obtain a palindromic subsequence by deleting elements according to a specific rule. The deletion rule is complex because it depends on the state of the array at the moment of deletion. A key observation is to simplify what can and cannot be changed.\n\nLet's first identify the elements that are \"fixed\" from the start. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. We can find the longest prefix of the array that matches the reversed suffix. Let's say this prefix (and suffix) has length `p`.\nSpecifically, we find the largest `p` such that `a[i] == a[n-1-i]` for all `i` from `0` to `p-1` (using 0-based indexing).\nThese `2p` elements form a \"palindromic frame\". It is always optimal to keep these elements, as deleting any of them would break a potential palindrome match. Thus, we should not delete any of `a[0...p-1]` or `a[n-p...n-1]`.\n\nAfter identifying this frame, we are left with the middle part of the array: `a[p...n-1-p]`. The problem reduces to determining if this middle part can be made into a palindrome. Since we've decided not to touch the frame elements, any deletion operation must target an element from this middle part. Furthermore, the chosen subarray `a[l...r]` for the operation must not contain any frame elements if we want to guarantee that a frame element isn't accidentally the k-th smallest and gets deleted.\n\nThis interpretation is too strict. A more relaxed view is that we can use the frame elements as part of our window `a[l...r]`, as long as the element we choose to delete is from the middle part. For example, to delete `a[p]`, we could use the window `a[p-k+1 ... p]`, which includes `k-1` elements from the frame.\n\nLet's consider two main cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.\n\n**Case 1: `2 * k <= n`**\nIf `n` is at least `2k`, we can always find two disjoint subarrays of length `k`. For instance, `a[0...k-1]` and `a[n-k...n-1]`. This provides a lot of flexibility.\nConsider any element `a[i]` we might want to delete. We can almost certainly construct a window of size `k` around it and manipulate the window's contents (by choosing its start and end) to make `a[i]` the k-th smallest. With `n >= 2k`, we have enough \"space\" in the array to form various windows. It turns out that if `n >= 2k`, we can delete any element we want from the middle part of the array, `a[p...n-1-p]`. Since we can delete any element, we can always reduce the middle part to an empty or single-element array, which is a palindrome. Therefore, if `n >= 2k`, the answer is always \"YES\".\n\n**Case 2: `2 * k > n`**\nThis is the more constrained case. Any two subarrays of length `k` must overlap.\nLet's find the longest palindromic frame of length `p` on each side. We are left with the subarray `a[p...n-1-p]`.\nIf this middle part is already a palindrome (i.e., its length is 0 or 1), the whole array is a palindrome. So, if `2p >= n-1`, the answer is \"YES\".\nOtherwise, `a[p] != a[n-1-p]`. We need to perform deletions. To delete an element `a[i]` from the middle part (`p <= i <= n-1-p`), we need to find a window `a[l...r]` of size at least `k` containing `i`.\nThe elements `a[0...p-1]` are available to the \"left\" of the middle part, and `a[n-p...n-1]` are available to the \"right\".\nConsider the leftmost element of the middle part, `a[p]`. To delete it, we can try to form a window `a[l...r]` around it. We have `p` elements to its left. The total number of elements from the start of the array up to `a[p]` is `p+1`. To form a window of size `k` containing `a[p]` that is as far left as possible, we would use `a[0...k-1]`. This is only possible if `p` is within this window, i.e., `p <= k-1`.\nA crucial insight is to consider what part of the array is \"stuck\" or hard to delete. The elements `a[n-k ... k-1]` (0-indexed) are part of every subarray of length `k` that spans across the center of the array. The elements we decided to keep from the frame are `a[0...p-1]`.\nThe elements from the middle part that we might not be able to delete are those that are \"shielded\" by the frame. The frame has `p` elements. To form a window of size `k` including elements from the frame and the middle, we essentially need `k-p` elements from the middle. Symmetrically, we need `k-p` elements from the other side of the middle.\nThe total number of middle elements we are forced to keep are those in the range `a[p ... k-1]` and `a[n-k ... n-p-1]`.\nSo, the subsequence formed by `a[p...k-1]` must be a palindrome with the subsequence `a[n-k...n-p-1]`. If `p >= k`, this range is empty, and we have enough \"leverage\" from the frame to delete anything. So if `p >= k`, the answer is YES.\nCombining these, if `n < 2k`, the answer is YES if and only if the subsequence `a[p...k-1]` is a reversed match for `a[n-k...n-p-1]`.\n\n**Final Algorithm:**\n1. If `n >= 2*k`, the answer is \"YES\".\n2. If `n < 2*k`:\n   a. Find the largest `p` such that `a[i] == a[n-1-i]` for `0 <= i < p`.\n   b. The middle part to consider is `a[p...n-1-p]`.\n   c. The elements that are difficult to remove are those from index `p` to `k-1` and from `n-k` to `n-1-p`. If `p >= k`, these ranges are empty, meaning we can remove anything from the middle. In this case, the answer is \"YES\".\n   d. If `p < k`, we check if the subarray `a[p...k-1]` matches the reverse of `a[n-k...n-1-p]`. If they match, the answer is \"YES\", otherwise it's \"NO\". Note that the length of the first part is `k-p` and the second is also `(n-1-p) - (n-k) + 1 = k-p`. So we just need to check if `a[p+i] == a[n-k+i]` for `0 <= i < k-p`.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nvoid solve() {\n    int n, k;\n    std::cin >> n >> k;\n    std::vector<int> a(n);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        std::cin >> a[i];\n    }\n\n    if (2 * k <= n) {\n        std::cout << \"YES\\n\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Case 2: 2 * k > n\n    int p = 0;\n    while (p < n / 2 && a[p] == a[n - 1 - p]) {\n        p++;\n    }\n\n    // The palindromic frame is a[0...p-1] and a[n-p...n-1]\n    // The middle part is a[p...n-1-p]\n    \n    // If p >= k, we have a frame of size k on each side, which gives enough\n    // flexibility to remove any element from the middle.\n    // The middle part can be cleared to form a palindrome.\n    if (p >= k) {\n        std::cout << \"YES\\n\";\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    // If p < k, we are constrained.\n    // The elements from index p to k-1 are \"stuck\" on the left side\n    // of the middle part, and n-k to n-1-p on the right.\n    // These two segments must form a palindrome with each other.\n    bool possible = true;\n    int len_stuck = k - p;\n    for (int i = 0; i < len_stuck; ++i) {\n        if (a[p + i] != a[n - k + i]) {\n            possible = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (possible) {\n        std::cout << \"YES\\n\";\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"NO\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    std::cin.tie(NULL);\n    int t;\n    std::cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        solve();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n```\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) citation_metadata=None finish_message=None token_count=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> url_context_metadata=None avg_logprobs=None grounding_metadata=None index=0 logprobs_result=None safety_ratings=None"
