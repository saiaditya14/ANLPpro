Minimize Fixed Points\" from Codeforces.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** Find a \"good\" permutation `p` of length `n` with the minimum possible number of fixed points.\n2.  **Permutation:** An array of length `n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly once.\n3.  **Good Permutation:** For all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, the condition `gcd(p_i, i) > 1` must hold. Note that there is no condition for `i=1`.\n4.  **Fixed Point:** An index `j` such that `p_j = j`.\n5.  **Minimizing Fixed Points:** We need to construct a permutation that satisfies the \"good\" condition and has the fewest possible indices `j` where `p_j = j`.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   Number of test cases, `t`: `1 <= t <= 10^4`\n*   Length of the permutation, `n`: `2 <= n <= 10^5`\n*   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.\n\n### Input/Output Format\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.\n    *   Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n`.\n*   **Output:**\n    *   For each test case, print `n` space-separated integers representing a valid permutation.\n\n### Examples\n\n| Input | Output |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| 4 | |\n| 2 | 1 2 |\n| 3 | 1 2 3 |\n| 6 | 1 4 6 2 5 3 |\n| 13 | 1 12 9 6 10 8 7 4 3 5 11 2 13 |\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nLet's analyze the conditions to find an optimal construction.\n\n**The case of `i=1`:**\nThe \"good\" condition `gcd(p_i, i) > 1` applies only for `i >= 2`. For `p_1`, there is no `gcd` constraint. However, `p` must be a permutation of `1, 2, ..., n`.\nConsider the value `1`. Where can it be placed in the permutation `p`? Let's say we place it at index `j`, so `p_j = 1`.\nIf `j >= 2`, the condition `gcd(p_j, j) > 1` must be satisfied. But `gcd(1, j) = 1`, which violates the condition. Therefore, the value `1` cannot be placed at any index `j >= 2`.\nThis forces the value `1` to be placed at index 1. So, for any good permutation, it must be that `p_1 = 1`. This means every good permutation must have at least one fixed point, at index 1. Our goal is now to minimize any other fixed points.\n\n**Constructing the permutation for `i >= 2`:**\nWe need to assign `p_i` for `i = 2, ..., n` using the values `2, ..., n` such that `gcd(p_i, i) > 1`. A simple and effective way to satisfy this is to ensure `p_i` is a multiple of `i`, or `i` is a multiple of `p_i`, or they share a common factor.\n\nA constructive approach is to group numbers and define permutations within these groups. A natural grouping is based on multiplication by 2. We can form chains: `i, 2*i, 4*i, 8*i, ...` as long as the terms are less than or equal to `n`. Every number from 1 to `n` belongs to exactly one such chain (the one starting with the largest odd divisor of the number).\n\nLet's process each number `i` from 1 to `n`. If `i` hasn't been assigned to a chain yet, start a new chain with it.\n*   **Chain starting with `i > 1`:**\n    Let the chain be `c_1, c_2, ..., c_k`, where `c_1 = i`, `c_2 = 2i`, etc. We need to assign the values `{c_1, ..., c_k}` to the indices `{c_1, ..., c_k}`. To avoid fixed points, we can use a cyclic shift: `p_{c_1} = c_2`, `p_{c_2} = c_3`, ..., `p_{c_{k-1}} = c_k`, and `p_{c_k} = c_1`.\n    Let's check the `gcd` condition for an index `c_j >= 2`.\n    *   For `j < k`, `p_{c_j} = c_{j+1} = 2*c_j`. `gcd(p_{c_j}, c_j) = gcd(2*c_j, c_j) = c_j`. Since `c_j = i * 2^{j-1}` and `i > 1`, `c_j > 1`. The condition holds.\n    *   For `j = k`, `p_{c_k} = c_1 = i`. `gcd(p_{c_k}, c_k) = gcd(i, i * 2^{k-1}) = i`. Since `i > 1`, the condition holds.\n    This cyclic shift creates no fixed points within the chain and satisfies the good permutation criteria.\n\n*   **Chain starting with `i = 1`:**\n    The chain is `1, 2, 4, 8, ...`. As we've established, we must have `p_1 = 1`. For the remaining indices `2, 4, 8, ...` and values `2, 4, 8, ...`, we can apply the same cyclic shift to avoid further fixed points: `p_2=4, p_4=8, ..., p_{c_k}=2`.\n\n*   **Chains of length 1:**\n    If for some `i`, we have `2*i > n`, the chain starting at `i` will have only one element: `i`. In this case, the only possible assignment is `p_i = i`, which creates a fixed point. This is unavoidable for such numbers (e.g., any prime `p` where `n/2 < p <= n`).\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize a permutation array `p` and a boolean `visited` array.\n2.  Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`.\n3.  If `i` has not been visited:\n    a. Build a chain of numbers starting with `i`: `i, 2*i, 4*i, ...` until the number exceeds `n`. Mark all numbers in the chain as visited.\n    b. If the chain has only one element, `p_i = i`.\n    c. Otherwise, perform a cyclic shift on the elements of the chain to define the permutation for those indices. For the chain starting at 1, `p_1` is fixed to 1, and the rest of the chain is cycled. For any other chain, the entire chain is cycled.\n\nThis construction yields a good permutation with the minimum number of fixed points.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <numeric>\n\nvoid solve() {\n    int n;\n    std::cin >> n;\n\n    std::vector<int> p(n + 1);\n    std::vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n        if (visited[i]) {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        std::vector<int> chain;\n        long long curr = i;\n        while (curr <= n) {\n            chain.push_back(curr);\n            visited[curr] = true;\n            curr *= 2;\n        }\n\n        if (chain.size() == 1) {\n            p[i] = i;\n        } else {\n            // All chains get a cyclic shift.\n            // p[c_1] = c_2, p[c_2] = c_3, ..., p[c_k] = c_1\n            for (size_t j = 0; j < chain.size() - 1; ++j) {\n                p[chain[j]] = chain[j + 1];\n            }\n            p[chain.back()] = chain[0];\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n        std::cout << p[i] << (i == n ? \"\" : \" \");\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    std::cin.tie(NULL);\n    int t;\n    std::cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        solve();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) citation_metadata=None finish_message=None token_count=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> url_context_metadata=None avg_logprobs=None grounding_metadata=None index=0 logprobs_result=None safety_ratings=None"
