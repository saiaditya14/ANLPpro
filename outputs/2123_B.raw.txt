Tournament\n\n**Goal:** Determine if a specific player `j` can possibly be among the last `k` remaining players in a tournament.\n\n**Tournament Rules:**\n* Start with `n` players, each with a given strength `a\u1d62`.\n* While the number of players is greater than `k`, two players are chosen.\n* The player with the lower strength is eliminated.\n* In case of a tie in strength, one player is eliminated.\n* The phrase \"is there any way\" implies that we can control the \"random\" choices of which players compete and who gets eliminated in a tie to favor player `j`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   Number of test cases `t`: `1 \u2264 t \u2264 10\u2074`\n*   Number of players `n`: `2 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u00b710\u2075`\n*   Target player index `j`: `1 \u2264 j \u2264 n`\n*   Final number of players `k`: `1 \u2264 k \u2264 n`\n*   Player strength `a\u1d62`: `1 \u2264 a\u1d62 \u2264 n`\n*   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2\u00b710\u2075`.\n\n**Input Format:**\n*   The first line is the number of test cases, `t`.\n*   For each test case:\n    *   The first line contains `n`, `j`, and `k`.\n    *   The second line contains `n` integers representing the strengths `a\u2081`, `a\u2082`, ..., `a\u2099`.\n\n**Output Format:**\n*   For each test case, print \"YES\" if player `j` can survive, and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case-insensitive.\n\n**Examples:**\n*   **Input 1:**\n    ```\n    3\n    5 2 3\n    3 2 4 4 1\n    5 4 1\n    5 3 4 5 2\n    6 1 1\n    1 2 3 4 5 6\n    ```\n*   **Output 1:**\n    ```\n    YES\n    YES\n    NO\n    ```\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the phrase \"determine if there is any way\". This means we can control the pairings to achieve the best possible outcome for player `j`. Our strategy is to keep player `j` safe for as long as possible.\n\nPlayer `j` is only eliminated if they are forced to play against an opponent with strictly greater strength. To keep player `j` safe, we can simply avoid picking them for any match, as long as there are other players available to compete.\n\nThe tournament proceeds by eliminating one player at a time, starting with `n` players, until `k` players remain. An elimination happens when the current number of players, let's say `m`, is greater than `k`.\n\nLet's analyze the condition under which we can avoid picking player `j` for a match. To hold a match without involving player `j`, we need to pick two other players. This is possible if and only if the number of other players is at least 2. If there are `m` players in total, there are `m-1` players other than `j`. So, we need `m-1 \u2265 2`, which simplifies to `m \u2265 3`.\n\nThis gives us two main cases based on the value of `k`:\n\n**Case 1: `k \u2265 2`**\n\nThe eliminations occur when the number of players `m` is `n, n-1, ..., k+1`.\nFor us to be able to always protect player `j`, we need to be able to select two other players at every step. This requires `m \u2265 3` for all these values of `m`. The smallest value `m` takes during the elimination phase is `k+1`.\nSo, we need `k+1 \u2265 3`, which means `k \u2265 2`.\nIf `k \u2265 2`, we can always conduct the required `n-k` eliminations by pairing up players other than `j`. Player `j` will never be forced to play and will therefore be one of the `k` survivors. In this case, the answer is always \"YES\".\n\n**Case 2: `k = 1`**\n\nIn this case, the condition `k \u2265 2` is not met. The tournament must continue until only one player, the champion, remains.\nFollowing the logic above, we can protect player `j` as long as `m \u2265 3`. However, the tournament continues until `m=2`. When two players are left, one of them must be player `j` (since we protected them). The other player, let's call them `p`, is the survivor of a sub-tournament among the other `n-1` players.\nSince we control the pairings in this sub-tournament, we can ensure its strongest player wins. So, player `p` will be the player with the maximum strength among everyone except `j`.\nThe final match is between `j` and `p`. For `j` to win, their strength must be greater than or equal to `p`'s strength (in a tie, we can choose for `j` to win). This is only possible if player `j`'s strength is the maximum (or tied for maximum) among all `n` initial players. If any other player is strictly stronger than `j`, that player will win the sub-tournament and defeat `j` in the final.\nSo, for `k=1`, the answer is \"YES\" if `a_j` is the maximum strength in the entire array, and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe overall algorithm is very simple:\n1.  Read `n, j, k` and the strengths array `a`.\n2.  If `k \u2265 2`, print \"YES\".\n3.  If `k = 1`, find the maximum strength in the array. If player `j`'s strength equals this maximum, print \"YES\". Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case to find the maximum strength, which is well within the time limits.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Function to solve a single test case\nvoid solve() {\n    int n;\n    int j_one_based, k;\n    std::cin >> n >> j_one_based >> k;\n    \n    std::vector<int> a(n);\n    int max_strength = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        std::cin >> a[i];\n        if (a[i] > max_strength) {\n            max_strength = a[i];\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Convert 1-based j to 0-based index\n    int j_zero_based = j_one_based - 1;\n\n    // Case 1: k >= 2\n    // We need to perform n-k eliminations.
