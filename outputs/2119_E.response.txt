### Solution Approach

The problem asks for the minimum number of operations to transform a sequence `b` into a new sequence `b'` such that `b'_i & b'_{i+1} = a_i` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n-1`. The only allowed operation is incrementing an element `b_i`, which means the final values must satisfy `b'_i ≥ b_i`. Minimizing the total number of operations is equivalent to minimizing the sum `Σ(b'_i - b_i)`, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing `Σb'_i`.

Let's analyze the constraints on the final sequence `b'`.

1.  **Bitwise AND Property:** The bitwise AND operation `x & y` results in a number where a bit is set only if it's set in both `x` and `y`. This implies that `(x & y) ≤ x` and `(x & y) ≤ y`. In our case, `a_i = b'_i & b'_{i+1}`, so `a_i` must be a "submask" of both `b'_i` and `b'_{i+1}`. This means all bits that are set in `a_i` must also be set in `b'_i` and `b'_{i+1}`.

2.  **Required Bits for `b'_i`:** From the condition `b'_{i-1} & b'_i = a_{i-1}` (for `i > 1`) and `b'_i & b'_{i+1} = a_i` (for `i < n`), we can deduce the minimum set of bits that `b'_i` must have.
    *   `b'_i` must be a supermask of `a_{i-1}`.
    *   `b'_i` must be a supermask of `a_i`.
    *   Therefore, `b'_i` must be a supermask of `a_{i-1} | a_i`.

Let's define a required mask `c_i` for each `b'_i`:
*   For `i=1`: `c_1 = a_1` (since it's only constrained by `a_1`)
*   For `1 < i < n`: `c_i = a_{i-1} | a_i`
*   For `i=n`: `c_n = a_{n-1}` (only constrained by `a_{n-1}`)

3.  **Minimal Values `L_i`:** For each `i`, `b'_i` must satisfy two conditions:
    a. `b'_i ≥ b_i` (from the operation rule)
    b. `b'_i` must be a supermask of `c_i`.

To minimize `Σb'_i`, we should choose the smallest possible value for each `b'_i` that independently satisfies these two conditions. Let's call this minimal candidate value `L_i`. `L_i` is the smallest integer such that `L_i ≥ b_i` and `(L_i & c_i) = c_i`. We can devise a function, `find_next_supermask(val, mask)`, to compute this value.

4.  **Verification and Final Check:** If a valid solution `b'` exists, then for each `i`, `b'_i ≥ L_i`. This implies `b'_i & b'_{i+1} ≥ L_i & L_{i+1}`. Since the solution must satisfy `b'_i & b'_{i+1} = a_i`, we must have `a_i ≥ L_i & L_{i+1}`.
However, by construction, both `L_i` and `L_{i+1}` are supermasks of `a_i`, which means `L_i & L_{i+1}` is also a supermask of `a_i`.
Combining `a_i ≥ L_i & L_{i+1}` and `L_i & L_{i+1}` being a supermask of `a_i`, the only possibility is `L_i & L_{i+1} = a_i`.

This gives us a clear algorithm:
1.  Compute the required masks `c_i` for `i = 1, ..., n`.
2.  For each `i`, compute the minimal candidate `L_i = find_next_supermask(b_i, c_i)`.
3.  Check if this set of `L_i` values forms a valid solution: for all `i = 1, ..., n-1`, verify if `L_i & L_{i+1} = a_i`.
4.  If the check passes for all `i`, a solution exists, and the minimum number of operations is `Σ(L_i - b_i)`.
5.  If the check fails for any `i`, no solution is possible, and the answer is `-1`.

The function `find_next_supermask(val, mask)` can be implemented efficiently using bit manipulation. If `val` is already a supermask of `mask`, we return `val`. Otherwise, we find the most significant bit `k` that `val` is missing from `mask`. The smallest number greater than `val` that has bit `k` set (and matches `val`'s bits higher than `k`) can be constructed. Then we OR this with `mask` to ensure all other required bits are set.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <cmath>

#if defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__clang__)
// Use GCC/Clang built-in function for counting leading zeros for performance.
#else
// Fallback for other compilers (e.g., MSVC).
#include <intrin.h>
long long __builtin_clzll(long long x) {
    unsigned long index;
    _BitScanReverse64(&index, x);
    return 63 - index;
}
#endif

// Finds the smallest integer x such that x >= val and (x & mask) == mask.
long long find_next_supermask(long long val, long long mask) {
    long long missing_bits = mask & ~val;
    if (missing_bits == 0) {
        return val;
    }

    // Find the position of the most significant missing bit.
    int k = 63 - __builtin_clzll(missing_bits);

    // Construct the smallest number > val that has bit k set and matches val's higher bits.
    // This is done by clearing the lower k+1 bits of val and adding 2^k.
    long long base = (val >> (k + 1)) << (k + 1);
    base += (1LL << k);

    // To satisfy the rest of the mask, we can simply OR with the mask.
    // The bits >= k in `base` will not be affected in a way that violates the mask.
    return base | mask;
