### Problem Breakdown

**Problem Statement:**
You are given an array `a` of size `n` and an integer `k`. You can perform an operation any number of times. The operation consists of:
1.  Selecting a contiguous subarray `a[l...r]` of the current array with length at least `k`.
2.  Finding the k-th smallest element `x` in this subarray.
3.  Choosing an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` where `a[i] == x` and deleting `a[i]` from the array.

The goal is to determine if it's possible to transform the array into a palindrome. An empty array is considered a palindrome.

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= t <= 10^4` (number of test cases)
*   `1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
*   `1 <= a_i <= n`
*   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

**Input Format:**
*   The first line contains `t`, the number of test cases.
*   For each test case:
    *   The first line contains `n` and `k`.
    *   The second line contains `n` integers representing the array `a`.

**Output Format:**
*   For each test case, output "YES" if the array can be made into a palindrome, and "NO" otherwise.

**Example:**

### Solution Approach

The problem asks if we can obtain a palindromic subsequence by deleting elements according to a specific rule. The deletion rule is complex because it depends on the state of the array at the moment of deletion. A key observation is to simplify what can and cannot be changed.

Let's first identify the elements that are "fixed" from the start. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. We can find the longest prefix of the array that matches the reversed suffix. Let's say this prefix (and suffix) has length `p`.
Specifically, we find the largest `p` such that `a[i] == a[n-1-i]` for all `i` from `0` to `p-1` (using 0-based indexing).
These `2p` elements form a "palindromic frame". It is always optimal to keep these elements, as deleting any of them would break a potential palindrome match. Thus, we should not delete any of `a[0...p-1]` or `a[n-p...n-1]`.

After identifying this frame, we are left with the middle part of the array: `a[p...n-1-p]`. The problem reduces to determining if this middle part can be made into a palindrome. Since we've decided not to touch the frame elements, any deletion operation must target an element from this middle part. Furthermore, the chosen subarray `a[l...r]` for the operation must not contain any frame elements if we want to guarantee that a frame element isn't accidentally the k-th smallest and gets deleted.

This interpretation is too strict. A more relaxed view is that we can use the frame elements as part of our window `a[l...r]`, as long as the element we choose to delete is from the middle part. For example, to delete `a[p]`, we could use the window `a[p-k+1 ... p]`, which includes `k-1` elements from the frame.

Let's consider two main cases based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

**Case 1: `2 * k <= n`**
If `n` is at least `2k`, we can always find two disjoint subarrays of length `k`. For instance, `a[0...k-1]` and `a[n-k...n-1]`. This provides a lot of flexibility.
Consider any element `a[i]` we might want to delete. We can almost certainly construct a window of size `k` around it and manipulate the window's contents (by choosing its start and end) to make `a[i]` the k-th smallest. With `n >= 2k`, we have enough "space" in the array to form various windows. It turns out that if `n >= 2k`, we can delete any element we want from the middle part of the array, `a[p...n-1-p]`. Since we can delete any element, we can always reduce the middle part to an empty or single-element array, which is a palindrome. Therefore, if `n >= 2k`, the answer is always "YES".

**Case 2: `2 * k > n`**
This is the more constrained case. Any two subarrays of length `k` must overlap.
Let's find the longest palindromic frame of length `p` on each side. We are left with the subarray `a[p...n-1-p]`.
If this middle part is already a palindrome (i.e., its length is 0 or 1), the whole array is a palindrome. So, if `2p >= n-1`, the answer is "YES".
Otherwise, `a[p] != a[n-1-p]`. We need to perform deletions. To delete an element `a[i]` from the middle part (`p <= i <= n-1-p`), we need to find a window `a[l...r]` of size at least `k` containing `i`.
The elements `a[0...p-1]` are available to the "left" of the middle part, and `a[n-p...n-1]` are available to the "right".
Consider the leftmost element of the middle part, `a[p]`. To delete it, we can try to form a window `a[l...r]` around it. We have `p` elements to its left. The total number of elements from the start of the array up to `a[p]` is `p+1`. To form a window of size `k` containing `a[p]` that is as far left as possible, we would use `a[0...k-1]`. This is only possible if `p` is within this window, i.e., `p <= k-1`.
A crucial insight is to consider what part of the array is "stuck" or hard to delete. The elements `a[n-k ... k-1]` (0-indexed) are part of every subarray of length `k` that spans across the center of the array. The elements we decided to keep from the frame are `a[0...p-1]`.
The elements from the middle part that we might not be able to delete are those that are "shielded" by the frame. The frame has `p` elements. To form a window of size `k` including elements from the frame and the middle, we essentially need `k-p` elements from the middle. Symmetrically, we need `k-p` elements from the other side of the middle.
The total number of middle elements we are forced to keep are those in the range `a[p ... k-1]` and `a[n-k ... n-p-1]`.
So, the subsequence formed by `a[p...k-1]` must be a palindrome with the subsequence `a[n-k...n-p-1]`. If `p >= k`, this range is empty, and we have enough "leverage" from the frame to delete anything. So if `p >= k`, the answer is YES.
Combining these, if `n < 2k`, the answer is YES if and only if the subsequence `a[p...k-1]` is a reversed match for `a[n-k...n-p-1]`.

**Final Algorithm:**
1. If `n >= 2*k`, the answer is "YES".
2. If `n < 2*k`:
   a. Find the largest `p` such that `a[i] == a[n-1-i]` for `0 <= i < p`.
   b. The middle part to consider is `a[p...n-1-p]`.
   c. The elements that are difficult to remove are those from index `p` to `k-1` and from `n-k` to `n-1-p`. If `p >= k`, these ranges are empty, meaning we can remove anything from the middle. In this case, the answer is "YES".
   d. If `p < k`, we check if the subarray `a[p...k-1]` matches the reverse of `a[n-k...n-1-p]`. If they match, the answer is "YES", otherwise it's "NO". Note that the length of the first part is `k-p` and the second is also `(n-1-p) - (n-k) + 1 = k-p`. So we just need to check if `a[p+i] == a[n-k+i]` for `0 <= i < k-p`.

        return;
    }

    // Case 2: 2 * k > n
    int p = 0;
    while (p < n / 2 && a[p] == a[n - 1 - p]) {
        p++;
    }

    // The palindromic frame is a[0...p-1] and a[n-p...n-1]
    // The middle part is a[p...n-1-p]
    
    // If p >= k, we have a frame of size k on each side, which gives enough
    // flexibility to remove any element from the middle.
    // The middle part can be cleared to form a palindrome.
    if (p >= k) {
        std::cout << "YES\n";
        return;
    }
    
    // If p < k, we are constrained.
    // The elements from index p to k-1 are "stuck" on the left side
    // of the middle part, and n-k to n-1-p on the right.
    // These two segments must form a palindrome with each other.
    bool possible = true;
    int len_stuck = k - p;
    for (int i = 0; i < len_stuck; ++i) {
        if (a[p + i] != a[n - k + i]) {
            possible = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (possible) {
        std::cout << "YES\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "NO\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
