Here is the analysis of the problem from the screenshot, a solution approach, and the C++ code.\n\n### Image Completeness Assessment\n\nYes, the image shows the full problem statement for \"B. Line Segments\" from Codeforces. It includes all the necessary details: the problem description, time and memory limits, input and output format specifications, constraints, and an example.\n\n---\n\n### Problem Details Extraction\n\n#### Constraints:\n*   **Number of test cases (t):** `1 <= t <= 10^4`\n*   **Number of operations (n):** `1 <= n <= 10^3`\n*   **Coordinates (p_x, p_y, q_x, q_y):** `1 <= p_x, p_y, q_x, q_y <= 10^7`\n*   **Move distances (a_i):** `1 <= a_i <= 10^4`\n*   **Total n:** The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.\n\n#### Input Format:\n1.  The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.\n2.  Each test case consists of three lines:\n    *   A single integer `n`, the number of moves.\n    *   Four integers `p_x, p_y, q_x, q_y`, representing the starting point `(p_x, p_y)` and the target terminal point `(q_x, q_y)`.\n    *   `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `a_i` is the exact distance to move in the i-th operation.\n\n#### Output Format:\n*   For each test case, output a single line containing \"YES\" if it is possible to reach the terminal point `(q_x, q_y)` after `n` operations, and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case-insensitive.\n\n#### Example:\nThe example input provided is:\n```\n5\n2\n1 1 5 1\n3 3\n3\n1 1 3 3\n1 3 3\n2\n2 3 4 2\n...\n```\nThe formatting in the screenshot is slightly ambiguous, but based on the problem description, here is the parsed input for the first two test cases and their expected output based on the correct logic:\n\n*   **Test Case 1:** Start at (1,1), end at (5,1). 2 moves of lengths 3 and 3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The required distance is 4. The moves sum to 6. The maximum move is 3. The achievable distance range is [|2*3 - 6|, 3+3] = [0, 6]. Since 4 is in this range, the answer is **YES**.\n*   **Test Case 2:** Start at (1,1), end at (3,3). 3 moves of lengths 1, 3, and 3.\n    *   **Analysis:** The required distance is `sqrt((3-1)^2 + (3-1)^2) = sqrt(8)`. The moves sum to 7. The maximum move is 3. The achievable distance range is [|2*3 - 7|, 1+3+3] = [|-1|, 7] = [1, 7]. Since `1 <= sqrt(8) <= 7` (or `1^2 <= 8 <= 7^2`), the answer is **YES**.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe problem asks if we can reach a target point `Q` starting from `P` by making `n` moves of specified lengths `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. In each move, we can choose any direction.\n\n1.  **Vector Representation:** Each move can be thought of as a vector `V_i` with a fixed magnitude `|V_i| = a_i` but an arbitrary direction. The final position will be `P + V_1 + V_2 + ... + V_n`. To reach `Q`, the total displacement vector `D = Q - P` must be equal to the sum of the move vectors: `D = V_1 + V_2 + ... + V_n`.\n\n2.  **Range of Displacement:** The core of the problem is to determine the range of possible magnitudes for the resultant vector `sum(V_i)`.\n    *   **Maximum Displacement:** The maximum possible magnitude is achieved when all vectors are aligned in the same direction. The total displacement is the sum of their lengths: `max_dist = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n`.\n    *   **Minimum Displacement:** The minimum displacement is found by arranging the vectors to cancel each other out as much as possible. By the polygon inequality theorem, the minimum magnitude of the sum is `max(0, 2 * a_max - sum_a)`, where `a_max` is the length of the longest move and `sum_a` is the sum of all move lengths. This corresponds to aligning all the smaller move vectors in the opposite direction to the largest one.\n\n3.  **Condition for Reachability:** The target point `Q` is reachable if and only if the straight-line distance between `P` and `Q` falls within the continuous range of achievable total displacements.\n    *   Let `Dist(P, Q)` be the Euclidean distance between the start and end points.\n    *   Let `sum_a = a_1 + ... + a_n`.\n    *   Let `a_max = max(a_1, ..., a_n)`.\n    *   The condition is: `max(0, 2 * a_max - sum_a) <= Dist(P, Q) <= sum_a`.\n\n4.  **Implementation without Floating-Point Errors:** To avoid precision issues with floating-point numbers (from `sqrt`), we can work with squared distances.\n    *   Calculate the squared required distance: `D_sq = (p_x - q_x)^2 + (p_y - q_y)^2`.\n    *   Calculate the squared minimum and maximum possible displacements:\n        *   `min_dist = max(0LL, 2LL * a_max - sum_a)`\n        *   `min_dist_sq = min_dist * min_dist`\n        *   `max_dist_sq = sum_a * sum_a`\n    *   The final check becomes: `min_dist_sq <= D_sq <= max_dist_sq`.\n\n5.  **Data Types:** The coordinates can be up to `10^7`, so their difference squared can be up to `(10^7)^2 = 10^{14}`. Similarly, the sum of `a_i` can be up to `10^3 * 10^4 = 10^7`, and its square can be `10^{14}`. Therefore, 64-bit integers (`long long` in C++) must be used for all distance and sum calculations to prevent overflow.\n\n### Full C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <numeric>\n#include <algorithm>\n#include <cmath>\n\n// Fast I/O for performance\nvoid fast_io() {\n    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    std::cin.tie(NULL);\n}\n\nvoid solve() {\n    int n;\n    std::cin >> n;\n    long long px, py, qx, qy;\n    std::cin >> px >> py >> qx >> qy;\n\n    long long sum_a = 0;\n    long long max_a = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        long long a;\n        std::cin >> a;\n        sum_a += a;\n        if (a > max_a) {\n            max_a = a;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Calculate the squared Euclidean distance required\n    long long dx = px - qx;\n    long long dy = py - qy;\n    long long dist_sq = dx * dx + dy * dy;\n\n    // Maximum possible displacement is the sum of all move lengths\n    long long max_dist_possible = sum_a;\n    long long max_dist_possible_sq = max_dist_possible * max_dist_possible;\n\n    // Minimum possible displacement based on polygon inequality\n    long long min_dist_possible = std::max(0LL, 2 * max_a - sum_a);\n    long long min_dist_possible_sq = min_dist_possible * min_dist_possible;\n\n    // Check if the required distance is within the achievable range\n    if (dist_sq >= min_dist_possible_sq && dist_sq <= max_dist_possible_sq) {\n        std::cout << \"YES\\n\";\n    } else {\n        std::cout << \"NO\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    fast_io();\n    int t;\n    std::cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        solve();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) citation_metadata=None finish_message=None token_count=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> url_context_metadata=None avg_logprobs=None grounding_metadata=None index=0 logprobs_result=None safety_ratings=None"
