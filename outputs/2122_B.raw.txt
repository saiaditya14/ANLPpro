The `i`-th pile initially consists of `a_i` zeros on top of `b_i` ones. The goal is to reach a target state where the `i`-th pile has `c_i` zeros on top of `d_i` ones. The only allowed operation is to take the top element of any pile and move it to any position in any pile (while maintaining the zeros-on-top-of-ones structure). We need to find the minimum number of operations to transform all piles from their initial state to the target state.\n\nIt's guaranteed that a solution exists, which implies the total number of zeros and ones are conserved across all piles: `\u03a3a_i = \u03a3c_i` and `\u03a3b_i = \u03a3d_i`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Number of test cases `t`: `1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4`\n- Number of piles `n`: `1 \u2264 n \u2264 2 * 10^5`\n- Pile compositions `a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i`: `0 \u2264 a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i \u2264 10^9`\n- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.\n\n**Input/Output Format:**\n- **Input:**\n    - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.\n    - Each test case starts with the number of piles, `n`.\n    - This is followed by `n` lines, each containing four integers: `a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i` describing the initial and target state of the `i`-th pile.\n- **Output:**\n    - For each test case, output a single integer: the minimum number of operations required.\n\n**Example:**\n- **Input:**\n```\n3\n2\n1 3 1 2\n1 1 1 2\n3\n1 1 1 2\n2 0 2 2\n1 1 1 1\n3\n2 0 2 2\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n- **Output:**\n```\n2\n2\n2\n```\n*(Note: The examples in the screenshot appear to have inconsistencies regarding the conservation of total ones. However, the problem guarantees that a valid transformation exists for the actual test data. The solution approach below relies on this guarantee.)*\n\n---\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of operations, where one operation is moving a single element. This is equivalent to finding the minimum number of elements that must be moved from their initial piles to reach the target configuration.\n\nWe can determine this minimum by considering each pile as a potential source of elements to be moved. The cost (number of moves) depends on the type of element (zero or one) that needs to be moved out.\n\n1.  **Accessibility Rule:** Zeros are on top of ones. To move a one from a pile, all the zeros on top of it must be moved first. This is the key constraint.\n\n2.  **Pile Categorization:** We can analyze each pile independently to determine the minimum number of elements that *must* be moved out from it.\n    *   **Case 1: Pile `i` is a source of ones (`b_i > d_i`)**\n        This pile has a surplus of `b_i - d_i` ones. To move these surplus ones, we must first access them by removing all `a_i` zeros from the top. Therefore, all `a_i` zeros must be moved, followed by the `b_i - d_i` surplus ones.\n        The total number of elements that must be moved from this pile is `a_i + (b_i - d_i)`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: Pile `i` is not a source of ones (`b_i \u2264 d_i`)**\n        We don't need to move any ones out of this pile. The ones are \"undisturbed\". We only need to consider the zeros.\n        *   **Subcase 2a: The pile is a source of zeros (`a_i > c_i`)**\n            The pile has a surplus of `a_i - c_i` zeros. Since these are on top, we can move them directly without disturbing the ones.\n            The number of elements to be moved from this pile is `a_i - c_i`.\n        *   **Subcase 2b: The pile is not a source of zeros (`a_i \u2264 c_i`)**\n            This pile does not have a surplus of either zeros or ones. It will only receive elements. No elements need to be moved *out* of this pile.\n            The number of moves originating from this pile is 0.\n\n3.  **Total Operations:**\n    The total minimum number of operations is the sum of the minimum moves originating from each pile. The problem guarantees that the total number of zeros and ones are conserved, so the elements moved out from source piles will be sufficient to satisfy the needs of the destination (sink) piles.\n\nThe overall algorithm is to iterate through each pile, classify it based on the logic above, calculate the moves required for that pile, and add it to a running total. Since the values of `a_i, b_i` can be large, the total number of operations can exceed the capacity of a 32-bit integer, so a 64-bit integer type (like `long long` in C++) should be used for the sum.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n// Function to solve a single test case\nvoid solve() {\n    int n;\n    std::cin >> n;\n    \n    long long total_operations = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        long long a, b, c, d;\n        std::cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;\n        \n        // Case 1: Pile is a source of ones (b_i > d_i)\n        // We must move all a_i zeros to access the b_i - d_i surplus ones.\n        if (b > d) {\n            total_operations += a + (b - d);\n        } \n        // Case 2: Pile is not a source of ones (b_i <= d_i)\n        // Check if it's a source of zeros.\n        else if (a > c) {\n            total_operations += a - c;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    std::cout << total_operations << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Fast I/O\n    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    std::cin.tie(NULL);\n    \n    int t;\n    std::cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        solve();\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) citation_metadata=None finish_message=None token_count=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> url_context_metadata=None avg_logprobs=None grounding_metadata=None index=0 logprobs_result=None safety_ratings=None"
