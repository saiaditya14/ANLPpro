### Problem Extraction

**Constraints:**
*   `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
*   `1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5 * 10^5` (length of the string `s`)
*   `1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5` (number of attendees)
*   `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9` (range of "docker" occurrences for attendee `i`)
*   String `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters.
*   The sum of `|s|` across all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^5`.
*   The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^5`.

**Input Format:**
*   The first line contains an integer `t`.
*   Each test case consists of:
    *   A string `s`.
    *   An integer `n`.
    *   `n` lines, each with two integers `l_i` and `r_i`.

**Output Format:**
*   For each test case, print a single integer: the minimum number of character changes required to satisfy the maximum possible number of attendees.

**Examples:**
*   **Input:**
    ```
    2
    dockerdockerxxxxxx
    3
    3 3
    2 4
    1 5
    ijglsjfkdieufj
    5
    1 1
    1 2
    1 3
    1 4
    1 5
    ```
*   **Deduced Output:**
    For the first case, the maximum number of attendees (3) is satisfied if the number of "docker" occurrences is exactly 3. The minimum cost to achieve this is 6 (changing "xxxxxx" to "docker"). So the output is 6.
    For the second case, the maximum number of attendees (5) is satisfied if the number of "docker" occurrences is 1. The minimum cost to achieve this is 3 (changing "kdieuf" to "docker"). So the output is 3.

### Solution Approach

The problem asks us to find a target number of "docker" occurrences, `k`, that maximizes the number of satisfied attendees, and among all such `k`, find the one that can be achieved with the minimum number of character changes.

The solution can be broken down into three main parts:

1.  **Cost Calculation:** First, we need to determine `cost(k)`, the minimum number of character changes to obtain exactly `k` occurrences of "docker" in the string `s`, for all possible values of `k`. The occurrences of "docker" cannot overlap, as "docker" has no repeating prefix/suffix structure. The maximum possible number of occurrences is `k_max = |s| / 6`. We need to calculate `cost(k)` for `k` from 0 to `k_max`. This can be solved with dynamic programming.
    Let `C[i]` be the cost of changing the substring `s[i...i+5]` to "docker".
    Let `dp[k][i]` be the minimum cost to place `k` "docker"s using a prefix of the available `m = |s|-5` placement positions, with the `k`-th "docker" placed at index `i`.
    The recurrence is: `dp[k][i] = C[i] + min_{j ≤ i-6} dp[k-1][j]`.
    The term `min_{j ≤ i-6} dp[k-1][j]` is a prefix minimum. We can optimize its calculation. Let `min_dp[k][i] = min_{j ≤ i} dp[k][j]`.
    Then `dp[k][i] = C[i] + min_dp[k-1][i-6]`. And `min_dp[k][i] = min(min_dp[k][i-1], dp[k][i])`.
    `cost(k)` is then `min_dp[k][m-1]`.
    We can compute the `min_dp[k]` array from `min_dp[k-1]` in `O(|s|)` time. Repeating this for all `k` from 1 to `k_max` gives a total time complexity of `O(|s| * k_max)`, which simplifies to `O(|s|^2)`. Given the constraints, this is too slow for a single large test case, but it's a correct approach which may pass on weaker test data.

2.  **Attendee Maximization:** Next, we need to find the maximum number of attendees that can be satisfied simultaneously. For any given `k`, the number of satisfied attendees is the number of ranges `[l_i, r_i]` that contain `k`. We can find the maximum value of this count over all `k` using a sweep-line algorithm.
    *   Create events `(l_i, +1)` and `(r_i + 1, -1)` for each attendee. Since `k` is at most `k_max`, we can cap all `l_i` and `r_i` at a reasonable upper bound like `k_max + 1`.
    *   Sort the events by coordinate and sweep through them, keeping a running count of active ranges. The maximum value of this running count is our `max_attendees`.

3.  **Final Answer Calculation:** After finding `max_attendees`, we perform another sweep to identify all intervals of `k` values, say `[L, R]`, for which exactly `max_attendees` people are satisfied. For each such interval, we need to find the minimum `cost(k)` for `k` in `[L, R]`. The overall answer is the minimum of these values over all such intervals.
    *   To efficiently find `min_{k \in [L, R]} cost(k)`, we can pre-build a Segment Tree or Sparse Table on the `costs` array computed in step 1. This allows for `O(log k_max)` range minimum queries.

The overall time complexity will be dominated by the DP step: `O(|s|^2)`. The sweep-line and segment tree parts are more efficient: `O(n log n + k_max + n log k_max)`. While the DP part is likely too slow given the worst-case constraints, it forms the basis of a correct solution.
