### Full Problem Statement Analysis

Yes, the image shows the full problem statement and all necessary details. Here's a summary:

**Problem Name:** A. Greedy Grid

**Problem Statement:**
A path in an `n x m` grid is defined as a sequence of cells starting from `(1,1)` and ending at `(n,m)`, moving only right or down.
- A path is called **greedy** if at every cell, it moves to the adjacent neighbor (right or down) that has a larger value. If the neighbors have equal values, either move is considered greedy.
- The **value** of a path is the sum of the numbers in all cells it visits.

The task is to determine if it's possible to create an `n x m` grid with non-negative integers such that **no greedy path** has the maximum possible value among all valid down/right paths.

### Constraints
- Number of test cases `t`: `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`
- Grid dimensions `n`, `m`: `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`

### Input/Output Format
- **Input:**
    - The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
    - Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the grid dimensions for that test case.
- **Output:**
    - For each test case, print "YES" on a new line if such a grid can be constructed, and "NO" otherwise. The output is case-insensitive.

### Examples
- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  3 3
  1 2
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  YES
  NO
  ```
- **Note:** The problem provides a sample `3x3` grid where no greedy path is maximal, explaining the "YES" case.

### Solution Approach

The core of the problem is to see if we can create a situation where the local optimal choice (the greedy move) leads to a globally suboptimal path sum. A greedy algorithm at a cell `(i,j)` decides its next move by comparing `grid[i][j+1]` and `grid[i+1][j]`. The true optimal path, however, depends on the total sum of the entire path, which can be found using dynamic programming.

Let `V(i,j)` be the maximum path sum from cell `(i,j)` to `(n,m)`. A conflict arises if we can make the greedy choice at a cell different from the optimal choice. For example, at the starting cell `(1,1)`, a greedy path will move right if `grid[1][2] > grid[2][1]`, while an optimal path will move right if `V(1,2) > V(2,1)`.

We can force a conflict if we can construct a grid where `grid[1][2] > grid[2][1]` (forcing greedy path right) but `V(1,2) < V(2,1)` (making the optimal path go down). Let's analyze if this is possible for different grid sizes.

1.  **`n=1` or `m=1`:** The grid is a single row or column. There is only one possible path. This path is trivially both greedy and maximal. Thus, it's impossible to create the required grid. The answer is **NO**.

2.  **`n > 1` and `m > 1`:** We need to analyze if a conflict can be constructed. A detailed analysis of the recurrence for `V(i,j)` shows that creating a conflict depends on having enough "space" in the grid to place large values that influence the optimal path without being the immediate choice for the greedy path.
    - **`n=2, m=2`:** It can be proven that `grid[1][2] > grid[2][1]` implies `V(1,2) > V(2,1)`. No conflict is possible. The answer is **NO**.
    - **`n=2, m=3` (or `n=3, m=2`):** Similarly, a rigorous case analysis shows it's impossible to satisfy the conflicting conditions. The answer is **NO**.
    - **`n=3, m=3`:** The problem note provides an example grid, proving it's possible. The answer is **YES**.
    - **`n=2, m=4` (or `n=4, m=2`):** It is possible to construct a grid. We can set up a conflict at cell `(1,2)`. We need `grid[1][3] > grid[2][2]` but `V(1,3) < V(2,2)`. This is achievable because we can place a large value at `grid[2][3]` to boost `V(2,2)` without affecting `V(1,3)` as much. For example: `grid[1][3]=5, grid[2][2]=4, grid[1][4]=0, grid[2][3]=2`. This satisfies `5>4` and `5+0 < 4+2`. The answer is **YES**.

**Conclusion:**
A grid where no greedy path is maximal can be constructed if and only if the grid is "large enough". Based on the case analysis, the "NO" cases are:
- `n=1` or `m=1`
- `(n,m) = (2,2)`
- `(n,m) = (2,3)` or `(3,2)`

All other cases result in "YES". We can implement this logic with a few conditional checks.

### C++ Solution

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to solve a single test case
void solve() {
    int n, m;
    std::cin >> n >> m;

    // By symmetry, we can assume n <= m to simplify the conditions.
    if (n > m) {
        std::swap(n, m);
    }

    // Case 1: If either dimension is 1, there's only one path.
    // This path is trivially both greedy and maximal.
    // So, it's impossible to construct the required grid.
    if (n == 1) {
        std::cout << "NO\n";
        return;
    }

    // Case 2: For a 2x2 or 2x3 grid, a greedy path is always a maximal path.
    // A detailed analysis shows that a contradiction arises when trying
    // to construct a counterexample.
    if (n == 2 && (m == 2 || m == 3)) {
        std::cout << "NO\n";
        return;
    }

    // Case 3: For all other grids (e.g., n=2,m>=4 or n>=3,m>=3),
    // it is possible to construct a grid where the greedy choice
    // leads to a sub-optimal path.
    std::cout << "YES\n";
}

int main() {
    // Fast I/O
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    std::cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }

    return 0;
}
