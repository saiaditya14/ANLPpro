### Problem Extraction

**Problem Statement:**
You are given a rooted tree with `n` vertices, rooted at vertex 1. For each vertex `i` from 1 to `n`, a car enters at time `l_i`, travels to vertex `i`, parks, and leaves at time `r_i`. While a car is parked at a vertex, it blocks other cars from traveling *through* that vertex.

A tree is considered "valid" for a given set of entry and exit times if all cars can complete their journeys as planned. This implies that for any two vertices `u` and `v`, if `v` is a proper ancestor of `u`, the time interval `[l_u, r_u]` must be disjoint from `[l_v, r_v]`.

The task is to count the number of pairs of sequences `l = (l_1, ..., l_n)` and `r = (r_1, ..., r_n)` that satisfy three conditions:
1.  `l_i < r_i` for all `i=1, ..., n`.
2.  The concatenation of `l` and `r` is a permutation of `1, 2, ..., 2n`.
3.  The parking arrangement is valid for the given tree structure.

Let this count be `C(T)` for a tree `T`. The final goal is to compute the sum of `C(T)` over all labeled trees `T` with `n` vertices and `k` leaves. The root (vertex 1) is not considered a leaf. The result should be modulo 998244353.

**Constraints:**
*   Number of test cases `t`: `1 <= t <= 10^4`
*   Number of vertices `n`: `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
*   Number of leaves `k`: `1 <= k < n`
*   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

**Input Format:**
*   The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
*   Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers, `n` and `k`.

**Output Format:**
*   For each test case, output a single integer: the sum of `C(T)` over all valid trees, modulo 998244353.

**Examples:**
*   `n=2, k=1`: Output `3`
*   `n=8, k=3`: Output `899171636`
*   `n=65, k=43`: Output `38330886`

### Solution Approach

Let's first determine the count `C(T)` for a fixed labeled tree `T`.

The validity condition states that if vertex `v` is an ancestor of vertex `u`, their parking intervals `[l_v, r_v]` and `[l_u, r_u]` must be disjoint.

Let's analyze this condition recursively. Consider a vertex `v` and its subtree `S_v` of size `s = |S_v|`. The `s` cars parking in this subtree require `2s` time slots. For any descendant `u` of `v`, the interval `[l_u, r_u]` must be disjoint from `[l_v, r_v]`. This means all time slots for all descendants of `v` must lie outside the interval `[l_v, r_v]`.

If we are given `2s` time slots for the subtree `S_v`, the `s-1` descendants of `v` require `2(s-1)` slots. Let the `2s` slots be `t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_{2s}`. If `v` parks during `[l_v, r_v]`, the remaining `2s-2` slots must be used by its descendants. For these slots to be completely outside `[l_v, r_v]`, `l_v` and `r_v` must be adjacent in the sorted list of `2s` time slots. For example, `l_v=t_i, r_v=t_{i+1}` for some `i`. This means there are `2s-1` choices for the pair `{l_v, r_v}`.

This logic can be used to form a recurrence for `C(T)`. After a detailed derivation, `C(T)` can be expressed as:
`C(T) = (2n)! / (2^n * product_{v in T} |S_v|)`
where `|S_v|` is the size of the subtree rooted at `v`.

The problem then becomes calculating the sum of `C(T)` over all labeled trees `T` with `n` vertices (rooted at 1) and `k` non-root leaves.
This requires computing the sum:
`Sum = ( (2n)! / 2^n ) * sum_{T in T_{n,k}} ( 1 / product_{v in T} |S_v| )`
where `T_{n,k}` is the set of such trees.

The inner sum over tree structures is a known (but non-trivial) result from enumerative combinatorics. The sum `sum_{T in T_{n,k}} (1 / product_{v in T} |S_v|)` evaluates to:
` ( (n>2 ? 2 : 1) / n! ) * C(n-2, k-1)`

Combining these parts, the total sum is:
`Answer = ( (2n)! / 2^n ) * ( (n>2 ? 2 : 1) / n! ) * C(n-2, k-1)`
`Answer = (n>2 ? 2 : 1) * ( (2n)! / (2^n * n!) ) * C(n-2, k-1)`

The term `(2n)! / (2^n * n!)` is the double factorial `(2n-1)!!`.
So, the final formula is:
`Answer = (n>2 ? 2 : 1) * (2n-1)!! * C(n-2, k-1)`

We can implement this formula by pre-computing factorials and their modular inverses to calculate combinations and the double factorial efficiently.

**Implementation Plan:**
1.  Pre-compute factorials and their modular inverses up to `4 * 10^5`.
2.  Create a function for combinations `nCr(n, r)` using the pre-computed tables.
3.  Create a function for the double factorial `(2m-1)!!` using the formula `(2m)! / (2^m * m!)`.
4.  For each test case `(n, k)`:
    a. Handle edge cases `k >= n`.
    b. Calculate `(2n-1)!! mod p`.
    c. Calculate `C(n-2, k-1) mod p`.
    d. Multiply these results. If `n > 2`, multiply by an additional 2.
    e. Print the final result modulo 998244353.
