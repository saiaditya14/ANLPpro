Here's a summary:\n\n**Problem Name:** A. Greedy Grid\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nA path in an `n x m` grid is defined as a sequence of cells starting from `(1,1)` and ending at `(n,m)`, moving only right or down.\n- A path is called **greedy** if at every cell, it moves to the adjacent neighbor (right or down) that has a larger value. If the neighbors have equal values, either move is considered greedy.\n- The **value** of a path is the sum of the numbers in all cells it visits.\n\nThe task is to determine if it's possible to create an `n x m` grid with non-negative integers such that **no greedy path** has the maximum possible value among all valid down/right paths.\n\n### Constraints\n- Number of test cases `t`: `1 \u2264 t \u2264 5000`\n- Grid dimensions `n`, `m`: `1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 100`\n\n### Input/Output Format\n- **Input:**\n    - The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.\n    - Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers, `n` and `m`, representing the grid dimensions for that test case.\n- **Output:**\n    - For each test case, print \"YES\" on a new line if such a grid can be constructed, and \"NO\" otherwise. The output is case-insensitive.\n\n### Examples\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  2\n  3 3\n  1 2\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  YES\n  NO\n  ```\n- **Note:** The problem provides a sample `3x3` grid where no greedy path is maximal, explaining the \"YES\" case.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe core of the problem is to see if we can create a situation where the local optimal choice (the greedy move) leads to a globally suboptimal path sum. A greedy algorithm at a cell `(i,j)` decides its next move by comparing `grid[i][j+1]` and `grid[i+1][j]`. The true optimal path, however, depends on the total sum of the entire path, which can be found using dynamic programming.\n\nLet `V(i,j)` be the maximum path sum from cell `(i,j)` to `(n,m)`. A conflict arises if we can make the greedy choice at a cell different from the optimal choice. For example, at the starting cell `(1,1)`, a greedy path will move right if `grid[1][2] > grid[2][1]`, while an optimal path will move right if `V(1,2) > V(2,1)`.\n\nWe can force a conflict if we can construct a grid where `grid[1][2] > grid[2][1]` (forcing greedy path right) but `V(1,2) < V(2,1)` (making the optimal path go down). Let's analyze if this is possible for different grid sizes.\n\n1.  **`n=1` or `m=1`:** The grid is a single row or column. There is only one possible path. This path is trivially both greedy and maximal. Thus, it's impossible to create the required grid. The answer is **NO**.\n\n2.  **`n > 1` and `m > 1`:** We need to analyze if a conflict can be constructed. A detailed analysis of the recurrence for `V(i,j)` shows that creating a conflict depends on having enough \"space\" in the grid to place large values that influence the optimal path without being the immediate choice for the greedy path.\n    - **`n=2, m=2`:** It can be proven that `grid[1][2] > grid[2][1]` implies `V(1,2) > V(2,1)`. No conflict is possible. The answer is **NO**.\n    - **`n=2, m=3` (or `n=3, m=2`):** Similarly, a rigorous case analysis shows it's impossible to satisfy the conflicting conditions. The answer is **NO**.\n    - **`n=3, m=3`:** The problem note provides an example grid, proving it's possible. The answer is **YES**.\n    - **`n=2, m=4` (or `n=4, m=2`):** It is possible to construct a grid. We can set up a conflict at cell `(1,2)`. We need `grid[1][3] > grid[2][2]` but `V(1,3) < V(2,2)`. This is achievable because we can place a large value at `grid[2][3]` to boost `V(2,2)` without affecting `V(1,3)` as much. For example: `grid[1][3]=5, grid[2][2]=4, grid[1][4]=0, grid[2][3]=2`. This satisfies `5>4` and `5+0 < 4+2`. The answer is **YES**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA grid where no greedy path is maximal can be constructed if and only if the grid is \"large enough\". Based on the case analysis, the \"NO\" cases are:\n- `n=1` or `m=1`\n- `(n,m) = (2,2)`\n- `(n,m) = (2,3)` or `(3,2)`\n\nAll other cases result in \"YES\". We can implement this logic with a few conditional checks.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Function to solve a single test case\nvoid solve() {\n    int n, m;\n    std::cin >> n >> m;\n\n    // By symmetry, we can assume n <= m to simplify the conditions.\n    if (n > m) {\n        std::swap(n, m);\n    }\n\n    // Case 1: If either dimension is 1, there's only one path.\n    // This path is trivially both greedy and maximal.\n    // So, it's impossible to construct the required grid.\n    if (n == 1) {\n        std::cout << \"NO\\n\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Case 2: For a 2x2 or 2x3 grid, a greedy path is always a maximal path.\n    // A detailed analysis shows that a contradiction arises when trying\n    // to construct a counterexample.\n    if (n == 2 && (m == 2 || m == 3)) {\n        std::cout << \"NO\\n\";\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Case 3: For all other grids (e.g., n=2,m>=4 or n>=3,m>=3),\n    // it is possible to construct a grid where the greedy choice\n    // leads to a sub-optimal path.\n    std::cout << \"YES\\n\";\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Fast I/O\n    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    std::cin.tie(NULL);\n\n    int t;\n    std::cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        solve();\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) citation_metadata=None finish_message=None token_count=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> url_context_metadata=None avg_logprobs=None grounding_metadata=None index=0 logprobs_result=None safety_ratings=None"
