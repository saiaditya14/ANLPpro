A logical analysis of the condition `a_1 & ... & a_n = a_1 \u2295 ... \u2295 a_n` shows that for some sample inputs (e.g., `n=2, l=3, r=6`), no solution should exist, yet a specific output (`4`) is provided. This suggests the screenshot might be a composite of a problem statement from one source and sample cases from another.\n\nI will proceed by providing a solution approach for the problem **as it is written in the problem statement**, and I will note that this solution will not reproduce all the provided sample outputs due to the inconsistency.\n\n### Problem Extraction\n\n**Problem:** Find the lexicographically smallest array `a` of length `n` with positive integer elements such that:\n1.  `l \u2264 a_i \u2264 r` for all `1 \u2264 i \u2264 n`.\n2.  The bitwise AND of all elements equals the bitwise XOR of all elements: `a_1 & a_2 & ... & a_n = a_1 \u2295 a_2 \u2295 ... \u2295 a_n`.\n\n**Output:** If a solution exists, print the `k`-th element of this array, `a_k`. Otherwise, print `-1`.\n\n**Constraints:**\n*   `t`: Number of test cases, `1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4`.\n*   `n, k`: `1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^18`.\n*   `l, r`: `1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^18`.\n\n**Input/Output Format:**\n*   **Input:** The first line contains `t`. Each subsequent test case is on a new line and contains four space-separated integers: `n, l, r, k`.\n*   **Output:** For each test case, print `a_k` or `-1`.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nLet's analyze the core condition `A = X`, where `A` is the bitwise AND of all elements and `X` is the bitwise XOR. We can analyze this condition bit by bit.\n\nFor any bit position `b`, let `c_b` be the count of numbers in the array `a` that have the `b`-th bit set.\n*   The `b`-th bit of `A` is 1 if and only if all `n` numbers have their `b`-th bit set, which means `c_b = n`.\n*   The `b`-th bit of `X` is 1 if and only if an odd number of elements have their `b`-th bit set, which means `c_b` is odd.\n\nFor the condition `A=X` to hold, their bits must be equal for all positions `b`. This means `(c_b = n)` must be logically equivalent to `(c_b is odd)`.\n\nLet's check this equivalence based on `c_b` and `n`:\n*   If `c_b = n`: The condition becomes `(true) == (n is odd)`. This holds only if `n` is odd.\n*   If `c_b < n`: The condition becomes `(false) == (c_b is odd)`. This holds only if `c_b` is even.\n\nSo, the conditions on `c_b` for each bit `b` depend on the parity of `n`:\n\n1.  **If `n` is odd:** For each bit `b`, `c_b` must either be `n` (all bits are 1) or be an even number less than `n`.\n2.  **If `n` is even:** For each bit `b`, `c_b` must be an even number less than `n`. The case `c_b=n` is not allowed because `n` is even, making the equivalence `(true) == (false)`, which is false.\n\nWith these conditions, we can find the lexicographically smallest array.\n\n#### Case 1: `n` is odd\nWe need to find the lexicographically smallest array `a`. This means we want to make `a_1` as small as possible, then `a_2`, and so on. The smallest possible value for any element is `l`.\nLet's consider the array `a = [l, l, ..., l]`.\n*   All elements are in the range `[l, r]`.\n*   Let's check the bitwise condition. For any bit `b`:\n    *   If the `b`-th bit of `l` is 1, then `c_b = n`. Since `n` is odd, this is a valid configuration.\n    *   If the `b`-th bit of `l` is 0, then `c_b = 0`. Since 0 is an even number less than `n`, this is also a valid configuration.\nThe array `[l, l, ..., l]` satisfies all conditions. Since `l` is the minimum allowed value, this array is the lexicographically smallest.\nThus, for an odd `n`, `a_k = l`.\n\n#### Case 2: `n` is even\nFor an even `n`, for each bit `b`, `c_b` must be an even number and `c_b < n`.\nThe array `[l, l, ..., l]` is not a valid solution because if any bit of `l` is 1, `c_b` for that bit would be `n`, which is not allowed.\n\nWe need to construct the lexicographically smallest array. Due to the very large values of `n` and `k`, the array structure must be simple. A likely candidate for the lexicographically smallest array would be one where most elements are `l`, and only a few (at the end of the array, to keep the prefix small) are changed to satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's try a simple structure: `a = [l, l, ..., l, x, x]` (i.e., `n-2` elements are `l`, and two are `x`).\n*   `a_1 = ... = a_{n-2} = l`. This is the smallest possible prefix of this length.\n*   We need to find the smallest `x` in `[l, r]` that makes this array valid.\n*   Let's check the bit counts `c_b` for this structure: `c_b = (n-2) * l_b + 2 * x_b`, where `l_b` and `x_b` are the `b`-th bits of `l` and `x`.\n*   Since `n` is even, `n-2` is also even. So `(n-2) * l_b` is always even.\n*   `2 * x_b` is also always even.\n*   The sum `c_b` is therefore always even.\n*   We also need `c_b < n`.\n    *   If `l_b=0` and `x_b=0`, `c_b=0 < n`. OK.\n    *   If `l_b=0` and `x_b=1`, `c_b=2 < n`. OK (since `n \\ge 2`).\n    *   If `l_b=1` and `x_b=0`, `c_b=n-2 < n`. OK.\n    *   If `l_b=1` and `x_b=1`, `c_b=n-2+2=n`. This is not allowed.\n*   So, for this array structure to be valid, we must ensure that for every bit `b`, it's not the case that both `l_b=1` and `x_b=1`. This is equivalent to the condition `l & x = 0`.\n\nSo, for `n` even, we seek the smallest `x \\in [l, r]` such that `l & x = 0`.\n*   `x` cannot be `l` because `l & l = l`, and `l \u2265 1`. So, `x` must be strictly greater than `l`.\n*   We need the smallest `x > l` such that `l & x = 0`. The smallest such `x` will be the smallest power of 2 that is strictly greater than `l`. Let's call this value `p2`. We can find it by starting with `p2=1` and repeatedly multiplying by 2 until `p2 > l`.\n*   If this `p2` is within our range (i.e., `p2 \u2264 r`), then we have found a valid construction for the lexicographically smallest array: `[l, l, ..., l, p2, p2]`.\n    *   If `k \u2264 n-2`, then `a_k = l`.\n    *   If `k > n-2` (i.e., `k=n-1` or `k=n`), then `a_k = p2`.\n*   If `p2 > r`, this simple construction is not possible. It's likely that no lexicographically smaller array exists, so no solution exists. We output `-1`.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nvoid solve() {\n    long long n, l, r, k;\n    std::cin >> n >> l >> r >> k;\n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) {\n        // If n is odd, the array [l, l, ..., l] is the lexicographically smallest solution.\n        // AND(l, l, ...) = l\n        // XOR(l, l, ...) = l (since n is odd)\n        // So a_k is always l.\n        std::cout << l << std::endl;\n    } else {\n        // If n is even, for each bit, the count of set bits must be even and less than n.\n        // The array [l, l, ..., l] is not a solution as c_b=n for bits set in l.\n        // The lexicographically smallest array is likely of the form [l, ..., l, x, x].\n        // This requires l & x = 0.
