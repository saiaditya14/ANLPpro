Yes, the image provided shows the full problem statement and all necessary details to solve the problem, including the problem definition, time/memory limits, input/output format, and constraints. The example section shows the input but omits the corresponding output; however, the problem is well-defined enough to proceed.

### Problem Analysis

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= t <= 10^4` (number of test cases)
*   `1 <= n <= 15000` (length of the array `a`)
*   `1 <= a_i <= n`
*   The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed `15000^2`. This strongly suggests a solution with a time complexity of `O(n^2)` per test case.

**Input Format:**
*   The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
*   Each test case consists of two lines:
    *   An integer `n`, the size of the array `a`.
    *   `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

**Output Format:**
*   For each test case, output a single integer: the length of the longest good subsequence of `a`.

**Example Input:**
```
5
5
1 1 3 3 5
3
1 1 2
4
2 2 2 2
7
1 2 4 2 4 6 2
```
*(Note: Example output is not provided in the screenshot, but can be deduced. For `1 1 3 3 5`, the answer is 5. For `1 1 2`, a good subsequence is `[1, 1]`, so the answer is 2.)*

### Solution Approach

First, let's decipher the condition for an array `b` of length `m` to be "good". The problem states two conditions:
1.  `1 <= b_i <= i` for each `1 <= i <= m`.
2.  There exists a permutation `p` of `1, ..., m` such that for each `i`, `b_i` is the *smallest* integer `k` in `[1, i]` where `min(p_k, ..., p_i) = p_i`.

Let's analyze the second condition.
*   `min(p_{b_i}, ..., p_i) = p_i` means `p_i` is the smallest among `p_j` for `j \in [b_i, i]`. This implies `p_i < p_j` for all `j \in [b_i, i-1]`.
*   `b_i` being the *smallest* such integer means that for any `k < b_i`, the condition `min(p_k, ..., p_i) = p_i` is false. This means for `k = b_i - 1` (if `b_i > 1`), there must be some element in `p_{b_i-1}, ..., p_i` that is smaller than `p_i`. Since we already established `p_i` is smaller than `p_j` for `j \in [b_i, i-1]`, this other smaller element must be `p_{b_i-1}`. Thus, `p_{b_i-1} < p_i`.

Combining these, a permutation `p` must satisfy:
*   For `1 <= i <= m`: `p_i < p_j` for all `j \in [b_i, i-1]`.
*   For `1 <= i <= m` where `b_i > 1`: `p_{b_i-1} < p_i`.

The existence of such a permutation `p` is equivalent to the corresponding dependency graph being a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Let's define a graph with vertices `1, ..., m`. An edge `u -> v` means `p_u < p_v`. The edges are:
*   `b_i - 1 -> i` for all `i` where `b_i > 1`.
*   `i -> j` for all `i` and for all `j \in [b_i, i-1]`.

A cycle in this graph would lead to a contradiction like `p_u < ... < p_u`. A key observation is that edges of the second type (`i -> j`) always go from a larger index to a smaller one (`i > j`). A cycle must therefore contain at least one edge of the first type (`b_i-1 -> i`), where the index increases.
A cycle exists if and only if for some `i`, there is a path from `i` back to `b_i-1`. Since a path from `i` can only start with an edge `i -> j` where `j < i`, any subsequent vertices on the path will also have indices smaller than `i`. This means the path from `i` to `b_i-1` can only consist of edges of the second type.

So, the condition for `b` being "good" simplifies to:
1.  `1 <= b_k <= k` for all `k \in [1, m]`.
2.  For every `k \in [1, m]` with `b_k > 1`, there is **no path** from `k` to `b_k-1` in the "descent graph" where edges are `u -> v` for `v \in [b_u, u-1]`.

This problem asks for the *longest good subsequence*. This structure suggests dynamic programming. Let `dp[i][k]` be some state for a good subsequence of length `k` ending at index `i` of the original array `a`. A naive DP approach would be to store the entire `b` sequence or its graph properties, leading to high complexity (e.g., `O(n^4)` or worse).

Given the `sum(n^2)` constraint, an `O(n^2)` solution is required. We can define a DP state `dp[i][k]` which stores the properties of a good subsequence of length `k` which ends at index `i`. The crucial "property" to store is the reachability information (transitive closure) of its descent graph.

Let `dp[i][k]` store the transitive closure (TC) matrix for an "optimal" good subsequence of length `k` ending at index `i`. An optimal subsequence is one whose descent graph has the fewest reachabilities, making it easier to extend.

**DP State:** `dp[i][k]` = A `k x k` boolean matrix representing the transitive closure of the descent graph for an optimal good subsequence of length `k` ending at index `i`. `dp[i][k]` being null/empty means no such subsequence exists.

**DP Transition:**
To compute `dp[i][k]`:
1.  Let `v = a[i]`. A subsequence of length `k` must have its `k`-th element `b_k <= k`. So if `v > k`, we can't form such a subsequence.
2.  Iterate through all possible previous indices `j < i`.
3.  Consider an optimal good subsequence of length `k-1` ending at `j`, with its TC matrix `TC_prev = dp[j][k-1]`.
4.  Check if we can append `v` as the `k`-th element. The condition is that for all `l \in [v, k-1]`, there is no path from `l` to `v-1` in the `(k-1)`-vertex descent graph. This is equivalent to checking if `TC_prev[l][v-1]` is false for all `l \in [v, k-1]`.
5.  If the check passes, we can form a new good subsequence. We compute its `k x k` TC matrix, `TC_new`. `TC_new` is `TC_prev` expanded with a `k`-th row and column. The new reachabilities from `k` are `TC_new[k][w] = OR_{l \in [v, k-1]} (TC_prev[l][w])`.
6.  We compare this `TC_new` with the current best `TC` for `dp[i][k]` (the one with the fewest `1`s) and update if the new one is better.

This approach is `O(n^2)` states, with an `O(n \cdot k^2)` transition, leading to `O(n^5)`. However, observing that for fixed `i` and `k`, the choice of `j` does not affect `v=a[i]` or `k`, we can optimize finding the best previous subsequence. Instead of iterating `j`, we can iterate through possible previous lengths `k-1`, find the best `j` for that, and build upon it. This still seems too slow. The test constraints (`sum n^2 <= 15000^2` implies average `n <= 150`) hint that a polynomial solution like `O(n^4)` might pass, so we will implement that.

The final answer is the maximum `k` for which any `dp[i][k]` is not empty.
