Solution Approach\n\nThe problem asks us to construct a permutation `a` of length `n` (containing numbers from 1 to `n`) such that for every prefix `A_i = [a_1, ..., a_i]`, the value of `f(A_i)` is equal to a given `x_i`.\n\nFirst, let's understand the function `f(a)`. It is the length `k` of a partition of `a` into `k` subarrays `s_1, ..., s_k`, which results in a lexicographically largest array `b = [min(s_1), ..., min(s_k)]`.\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand how the sequence `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` constrains the structure of the permutation `a`. Let's analyze the change from `f(A_{i-1})` to `f(A_i)`. When we append a new element `a_i` to `A_{i-1}`, we get `A_i`. The optimal partition for `A_i` can be related to the optimal partition for `A_{i-1}`. It can be shown that if a solution exists, the sequence `x` must be non-decreasing, and `x_i` can be at most `x_{i-1} + 1`. Also, `x_1` must be 1.\n\nThis structure suggests that the `x` sequence defines a partition of the indices `{1, ..., n}` into groups.\n*   When `x_i = x_{i-1} + 1` (for `i>1`, with `x_0=0`), `a_i` starts a new conceptual group.\n*   When `x_i = x_{i-1}`, `a_i` joins the most recently started group.\n\nThis partitioning of indices `{1, ..., n}` gives us segments that must correspond to the segments in our constructed permutation `a`. For example, if `x = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]`, the groups of indices are `{1}`, `{2, 3}`, `{4}`, `{5, 6}`. This suggests the permutation `a` will be structured as segments `[a_1]`, `[a_2, a_3]`, `[a_4]`, `[a_5, a_6]`.\n\nFor this structure to be optimal for all prefixes, certain inequalities must hold between adjacent elements of `a`:\n1.  **Within a group/segment `[a_b, ..., a_e]`:** The elements must be in increasing order: `a_b < a_{b+1} < ... < a_e`. This encourages merging. For example, for `[v_1, v_2]` with `v_1 < v_2`, the optimal partition is `[v_1, v_2]`, giving `b=[v_1]`, which can be lexicographically better than `[v_1], [v_2]` which gives `b=[v_1, v_2]` if something larger follows. The problem is subtle, but an increasing sequence within a segment is the right direction. For `[1,2,3]`, `f=2` with `b=[1,3]`, while for `[1,3,2]`, `f=3` with `b=[1,3,2]`.\n2.  **Between groups/segments:** Let `a_e` be the last element of one group and `a_{e+1}` be the first of the next. We need `a_e > a_{e+1}`. This encourages a partition break. For `[v_1, v_2]` with `v_1 > v_2`, the optimal partition is `[v_1], [v_2]`, giving `b=[v_1, v_2]`, which is lexicographically larger than `[v_2]`.\n\nSo, we have a set of inequalities. We can construct a permutation that satisfies them by assigning numbers from `n` down to `1`. The elements at the end of each group, `a_e`, are \"peaks\". They must be larger than what comes after them. The other elements are \"valleys\".\n\nHere is a constructive algorithm:\n1.  First, perform sanity checks on the input `x` sequence. If `x_1 != 1`, or if for any `i>1`, `x_i < x_{i-1}` or `x_i > x_{i-1} + 1`, no such permutation can exist, so we output \"NO\".\n2.  Identify the groups based on the `x` sequence. An index `i` starts a new group if `i=1` or `x_i > x_{i-1}`.\n3.  This partitions the indices `{1, ..., n}` into segments. Let the endpoints of these segments be `e_1, e_2, ..., e_k`.\n4.  To satisfy the inequalities, we should assign the largest values to the \"peaks\", i.e., the elements at the end of each segment. Let's assign `n` to `a_{e_1}`, `n-1` to `a_{e_2}`, and so on.\n5.  The remaining `n-k` numbers (`1, ..., n-k`) are assigned to the remaining `n-k` positions in `a`. To maintain the increasing order within segments, we can assign these remaining numbers in decreasing order to the remaining indices, also sorted in decreasing order. A simpler way is to fill values for groups from right-to-left.\n\nLet's refine the assignment part:\n1.  Determine the segments (groups of indices) as described above.\n2.  Let `val = n`.\n3.  Iterate through the groups from right to left (i.e., from the last group to the first).\n4.  For each group, iterate through its indices from right to left, assigning `val` and decrementing it.\n5.  This ensures that within a group `[a_b, ..., a_e]`, `a_b < ... < a_e`. It also ensures that for adjacent groups ending at `e` and starting at `e+1`, `a_e` (assigned from an earlier-processed group, so smaller `val`s) is smaller than `a_{e+1}` (assigned from a later-processed group, so larger `val`s). This contradicts the required `a_e > a_{e+1}`.\n\nLet's try another assignment:\n1.  Identify segments. Find the endpoints `e_1, e_2, ..., e_k`.\n2.  Assign the largest `k` values (`n, n-1, ..., n-k+1`) to the peak positions `a_{e_1}, a_{e_2}, ..., a_{e_k}` respectively.\n3.  Assign the remaining `n-k` values (`1, ..., n-k`) to the non-peak positions. To satisfy the intra-group increasing order, we can assign these values greedily. A simple way is to assign them in decreasing order to the remaining indices also in decreasing order.\n\nLet's trace this second approach: `n=7, x=[1,2,2,3,4,4,4]`.\n- Groups by indices: `{1}, {2,3}, {4}, {5,6,7}`.\n- Endpoints: `e_1=1, e_2=3, e_3=4, e_4=7`. `k=4`.\n- Assign peaks: `a_1=7, a_3=6, a_4=5, a_7=4`.\n- Remaining indices: `2, 5, 6`. Remaining values: `1, 2, 3`.\n- Assign `3` to index `6`, `2` to index `5`, `1` to index `2`.\n- `a = [7, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3, 4]`.\n- Check inequalities:\n  - Within groups: `{1}` (ok), `{2,3}`: `a_2=1 < a_3=6` (ok), `{4}` (ok), `{5,6,7}`: `a_5=2 < a_6=3 < a_7=4` (ok).\n  - Between groups: `a_1=7 > a_2=1` (ok), `a_3=6 > a_4=5` (ok), `a_4=5 > a_5=2` (ok).\nThis construction works.\n\n### 4.
