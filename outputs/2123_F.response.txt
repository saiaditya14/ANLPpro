Yes, the image provided shows the full problem statement and all necessary details for solving the problem "F. Minimize Fixed Points" from Codeforces.

### Problem Analysis

1.  **Goal:** Find a "good" permutation `p` of length `n` with the minimum possible number of fixed points.
2.  **Permutation:** An array of length `n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly once.
3.  **Good Permutation:** For all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, the condition `gcd(p_i, i) > 1` must hold. Note that there is no condition for `i=1`.
4.  **Fixed Point:** An index `j` such that `p_j = j`.
5.  **Minimizing Fixed Points:** We need to construct a permutation that satisfies the "good" condition and has the fewest possible indices `j` where `p_j = j`.

### Constraints

*   Number of test cases, `t`: `1 <= t <= 10^4`
*   Length of the permutation, `n`: `2 <= n <= 10^5`
*   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `10^5`.

### Input/Output Format

*   **Input:**
    *   The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
    *   Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n`.
*   **Output:**
    *   For each test case, print `n` space-separated integers representing a valid permutation.

### Solution Approach

Let's analyze the conditions to find an optimal construction.

**The case of `i=1`:**
The "good" condition `gcd(p_i, i) > 1` applies only for `i >= 2`. For `p_1`, there is no `gcd` constraint. However, `p` must be a permutation of `1, 2, ..., n`.
Consider the value `1`. Where can it be placed in the permutation `p`? Let's say we place it at index `j`, so `p_j = 1`.
If `j >= 2`, the condition `gcd(p_j, j) > 1` must be satisfied. But `gcd(1, j) = 1`, which violates the condition. Therefore, the value `1` cannot be placed at any index `j >= 2`.
This forces the value `1` to be placed at index 1. So, for any good permutation, it must be that `p_1 = 1`. This means every good permutation must have at least one fixed point, at index 1. Our goal is now to minimize any other fixed points.

**Constructing the permutation for `i >= 2`:**
We need to assign `p_i` for `i = 2, ..., n` using the values `2, ..., n` such that `gcd(p_i, i) > 1`. A simple and effective way to satisfy this is to ensure `p_i` is a multiple of `i`, or `i` is a multiple of `p_i`, or they share a common factor.

A constructive approach is to group numbers and define permutations within these groups. A natural grouping is based on multiplication by 2. We can form chains: `i, 2*i, 4*i, 8*i, ...` as long as the terms are less than or equal to `n`. Every number from 1 to `n` belongs to exactly one such chain (the one starting with the largest odd divisor of the number).

Let's process each number `i` from 1 to `n`. If `i` hasn't been assigned to a chain yet, start a new chain with it.
*   **Chain starting with `i > 1`:**
    Let the chain be `c_1, c_2, ..., c_k`, where `c_1 = i`, `c_2 = 2i`, etc. We need to assign the values `{c_1, ..., c_k}` to the indices `{c_1, ..., c_k}`. To avoid fixed points, we can use a cyclic shift: `p_{c_1} = c_2`, `p_{c_2} = c_3`, ..., `p_{c_{k-1}} = c_k`, and `p_{c_k} = c_1`.
    Let's check the `gcd` condition for an index `c_j >= 2`.
    *   For `j < k`, `p_{c_j} = c_{j+1} = 2*c_j`. `gcd(p_{c_j}, c_j) = gcd(2*c_j, c_j) = c_j`. Since `c_j = i * 2^{j-1}` and `i > 1`, `c_j > 1`. The condition holds.
    *   For `j = k`, `p_{c_k} = c_1 = i`. `gcd(p_{c_k}, c_k) = gcd(i, i * 2^{k-1}) = i`. Since `i > 1`, the condition holds.
    This cyclic shift creates no fixed points within the chain and satisfies the good permutation criteria.

*   **Chain starting with `i = 1`:**
    The chain is `1, 2, 4, 8, ...`. As we've established, we must have `p_1 = 1`. For the remaining indices `2, 4, 8, ...` and values `2, 4, 8, ...`, we can apply the same cyclic shift to avoid further fixed points: `p_2=4, p_4=8, ..., p_{c_k}=2`.

*   **Chains of length 1:**
    If for some `i`, we have `2*i > n`, the chain starting at `i` will have only one element: `i`. In this case, the only possible assignment is `p_i = i`, which creates a fixed point. This is unavoidable for such numbers (e.g., any prime `p` where `n/2 < p <= n`).

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize a permutation array `p` and a boolean `visited` array.
2.  Iterate `i` from 1 to `n`.
3.  If `i` has not been visited:
    a. Build a chain of numbers starting with `i`: `i, 2*i, 4*i, ...` until the number exceeds `n`. Mark all numbers in the chain as visited.
    b. If the chain has only one element, `p_i = i`.
    c. Otherwise, perform a cyclic shift on the elements of the chain to define the permutation for those indices. For the chain starting at 1, `p_1` is fixed to 1, and the rest of the chain is cycled. For any other chain, the entire chain is cycled.

This construction yields a good permutation with the minimum number of fixed points.

            // All chains get a cyclic shift.
            // p[c_1] = c_2, p[c_2] = c_3, ..., p[c_k] = c_1
