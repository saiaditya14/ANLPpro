Among all paths with the minimum total time, find the one that minimizes the total time spent waiting.\n\n**State and Transitions:** The problem can be modeled as a shortest path problem on a state graph. A state is defined not just by the current vertex `u`, but also by the current time `t`, since the available move depends on `t`.\n- A state can be represented as `(u, t)`, meaning we are at vertex `u` at time `t`.\n- From state `(u, t)`, we have two types of transitions, each taking one second:\n    1.  **Wait:** Transition to state `(u, t+1)`. This increases total time by 1 and wait time by 1.\n    2.  **Move:** Transition to state `(v, t+1)`. This is only possible if `v` is the neighbor connected by the `(t mod deg(u) + 1)`-th edge of `u`. This increases total time by 1, but wait time remains unchanged.\n\nThe state space `(u, t)` is infinite because time `t` can increase indefinitely. A standard shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra needs a finite (or practically finite) number of states.\n\n### Constraints\n\n*   **Number of test cases (t):** `1 <= t <= 1000`\n*   **Number of vertices (n):** `2 <= n <= 5000`\n*   **Number of edges (m):** `n-1 <= m <= n(n-1)/2`\n*   **Sum of n over all test cases:** ` <= 5000`\n*   **Sum of m over all test cases:** ` <= 5 * 10^5`\n*   The graph is simple (no self-loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices) and connected.\n\n### Input/Output Format\n\n*   **Input:**\n    *   The first line contains `t`, the number of test cases.\n    *   Each test case starts with a line containing `n` and `m`.\n    *   The next `m` lines each contain two integers `u_i` and `v_i`, describing an edge. The order of these edges in the input determines the 1-based index for each vertex's adjacency list.\n*   **Output:**\n    *   For each test case, print a single line with two integers: the minimum total time to reach vertex `n`, and the minimum waiting time for a path that achieves this minimum total time.\n\n### Example\n\n*   **Input:**\n    ```\n    2\n    6 6\n    1 2\n    2 3\n    3 4\n    4 6\n    1 5\n    5 6\n    ... (rest of input not fully visible, but first case is complete)\n    ```\n*   **Analysis of first example:**\n    The graph has two disjoint paths from 1 to 6: `1-2-3-4-6` and `1-5-6`. All vertices have a degree of 2.\n    - Let's trace path `1 -> 5 -> 6`:\n        - At `(1, 0)`, `deg(1)=2`. The edges are `(1,2)` (1st) and `(1,5)` (2nd). `(0 mod 2) + 1 = 1`, so we must take the edge to 2. To go to 5, we must wait.\n        - Wait at 1 for 1 second. State becomes `(1, 1)`. Total time: 1, Wait time: 1.\n        - At `(1, 1)`, `(1 mod 2) + 1 = 2`. We can now take the 2nd edge to 5.\n        - Move `1 -> 5`. Arrive at `(5, 2)`. Total time: 2, Wait time: 1.\n        - At `(5, 2)`, `deg(5)=2`. Edges are `(5,1)` (1st), `(5,6)` (2nd). `(2 mod 2) + 1 = 1`. We must take the edge to 1. To go to 6, we must wait.\n        - Wait at 5 for 1 second. State becomes `(5, 3)`. Total time: 3, Wait time: 2.\n        - At `(5, 3)`, `(3 mod 2) + 1 = 2`. We can take the 2nd edge to 6.\n        - Move `5 -> 6`. Arrive at `(6, 4)`. **Total time: 4, Wait time: 2.**\n    This seems to be one possible path. The optimal one might be different.\n\n### Solution Approach\n\nThe key challenge is the infinite state space. We can observe that arriving at a vertex `u` at a much later time is generally not better. An arrival time `t` is \"lucky\" if `t mod deg(u)` allows for an immediate desired move. The maximum wait time at any vertex `u` is `deg(u) - 1`. This suggests that if we arrive at `u` at time `t\u2081` and also at `t\u2082` where `t\u2082` is much larger than `t\u2081`, the path through `t\u2082` is likely suboptimal.\n\nThis leads to a powerful heuristic: for each vertex `u`, we only need to keep track of states `(u, t)` where `t` is \"close\" to `min_t[u]`, the minimum time found so far to reach `u`. We can define \"close\" as being within a time window of a constant `C`. Let `dt = t - min_t[u]`. We only explore states where `0 <= dt < C`.\n\nThis transforms the problem into a Dijkstra's algorithm on a finite state graph where states are `(u, dt)`. The number of states becomes `n * C`. With `sum(n) <= 5000` and a reasonable constant `C` (e.g., 600, which is larger than most practical vertex degrees), this approach is feasible.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **State Representation:** A state in our Dijkstra priority queue will be `(total_time, wait_time, u)`.\n2.  **Distance Tracking:** We'll use two arrays:\n    *   `min_t[u]`: stores the minimum total time found so far to reach vertex `u`.\n    *   `min_w[u][dt]`: stores the minimum wait time to reach vertex `u` at time `min_t[u] + dt`.\n3.  **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**\n    *   Initialize `min_t` and `min_w` to infinity.\n    *   Set `min_t[1] = 0`, `min_w[1][0] = 0` and push `{0, 0, 1}` to the priority queue.\n    *   While the priority queue is not empty, extract the state `{t, w, u}` with the minimum `t` (and `w` as a tie-breaker).\n    *   Let `dt = t - min_t[u]`. If `dt >= C` or this state is already processed with a better wait time (`w > min_w[u][dt]`), skip it.\n    *   From state `(u,t)`:\n        *   **Wait:** A new state is reached at vertex `u` at time `t+1` with wait time `w+1`. If `t+1` is within the time window (`t+1 < min_t[u] + C`), update `min_w` and push to the queue if a better path is found.\n        *   **Move:** Determine the neighbor `v` based on `(t mod deg(u) + 1)`. A new state is reached at `v` at `t+1` with wait time `w`.\n            *   If this path is the new best overall path to `v` (`t+1 < min_t[v]`), update `min_t[v]`, set `min_w[v][0] = w`, and push to the queue.\n            *   Otherwise, calculate `dt_new = (t+1) - min_t[v]`. If `dt_new < C`, update `min_w[v][dt_new]` and push if a better path for this specific state `(v, dt_new)` is found.\n4.  The final answer for vertex `n` is found once Dijkstra terminates. We can keep track of the best `{total_time, wait_time}` pair for vertex `n` as we encounter it.\n\n### C++ Solution\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <queue>\n#include <tuple>\n#include <utility>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nconst long long INF = 1e18;\nconst int C = 600; // Heuristic constant for time delta window\n\n// State for priority queue\nstruct State {\n    long long total_time;\n    long long wait_time;\n    int u;\n\n    bool operator>(const State& other) const {\n        if (total_time != other.total_time) {\n            return total_time > other.total_time;\n        }\n        return wait_time > other.wait_time;\n    }\n};\n\nvoid solve() {\n    int n;\n    int m;\n    cin >> n >> m;\n\n    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj_input_order(n + 1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {\n        int u, v;\n        cin >> u >> v;\n        adj_input_order[u].push_back({v, 0});\n        adj_input_order[v].push_back({u, 0});\n    }\n\n    vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> adj(n + 1);\n    vector<int> deg(n + 1, 0);\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n        deg[i] = adj_input_order[i].size();\n        int edge_idx = 1;\n        for(auto p : adj_input_order[i]) {\n            adj[i].push_back({p.first, edge_idx++});\n        }\n    }\n\n    vector<long long> min_t(n + 1, INF);\n    vector<vector<long long>> min_w(n + 1, vector<long long>(C, INF));\n\n    priority_queue<State, vector<State>, greater<State>> pq;\n\n    min_t[1] = 0;\n    min_w[1][0] = 0;\n    pq.push({0, 0, 1});\n\n    pair<long long, long long> ans = {INF, INF};\n\n    while (!pq.empty()) {\n        auto [t, w, u] = pq.top();\n        pq.pop();\n\n        if (min_t[u] == INF || t > min_t[u] + C) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        int dt = t - min_t[u];\n        if (dt >= C || w > min_w[u][dt]) {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        if (u == n) {\n             if (t < ans.first || (t == ans.first && w < ans.second)) {\n                ans = {t, w};\n            }\n        }\n        \n        if (t > ans.first) continue;\n\n        // Option 1: Wait\n        long long t_new_wait = t + 1;\n        long long w_new_wait = w + 1;\n\n        if (t_new_wait < min_t[u] + C) {\n            int dt_new = dt + 1;\n            if (w_new_wait < min_w[u][dt_new]) {\n                min_w[u][dt_new] = w_new_wait;\n                pq.push({t_new_wait, w_new_wait, u});\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Option 2: Move\n        if (deg[u] > 0) {\n            int edge_idx_to_take = (t % deg[u]) + 1;\n            int v = -1;\n            for (const auto& edge : adj[u]) {\n                if (edge.second == edge_idx_to_take) {\n                    v = edge.first;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            \n            if (v != -1) {\n                long long t_new_move = t + 1;\n                long long w_new_move = w;\n\n                if (t_new_move < min_t[v]) {\n                    min_t[v] = t_new_move;\n                    min_w[v][0] = w_new_move;\n                    pq.push({t_new_move, w_new_move, v});\n                } else {\n                    int dt_new = t_new_move - min_t[v];\n                    if (dt_new < C) {\n                        if (w_new_move < min_w[v][dt_new]) {\n                            min_w[v][dt_new] = w_new_move;\n                            pq.push({t_new_move, w_new_move, v});\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    cout << ans.first << \" \" << ans.second << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n    cin.tie(NULL);\n    int t;\n    cin >> t;\n    while (t--) {\n        solve();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) citation_metadata=None finish_message=None token_count=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> url_context_metadata=None avg_logprobs=None grounding_metadata=None index=0 logprobs_result=None safety_ratings=None"
