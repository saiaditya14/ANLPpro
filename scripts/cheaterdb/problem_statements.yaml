    This is an interactive problem. Refer to the Interaction section below for better
    understanding.

    There are $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 40$$$) batteries numbered $$$1, 2, \ldots, n$$$.
    Some of them work while the others don''t. Let $$$a$$$ be the number of batteries
    that work. It is guaranteed that $$$\mathbf{a \geq 2}$$$.

    You are given $$$n$$$ but

    not

    $$$a$$$.

    There is a flashlight which can hold two batteries and it only turns on when both
    batteries work. The batteries have been shuffled and you don''t know which ones
    work and which ones don''t. You can choose two batteries and try them in the flashlight.

    You want to find a pair of batteries that work. However, you are worried about
    breaking the flashlight, so you want to limit the amount of trials you attempt.

    Therefore, you should find a pair of working batteries using at most $$$\left
    \lfloor \frac{n^2}{a} \right \rfloor$$$ trials.

    The interactor is

    adaptive

    . This means that whether battery $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n$$$) works is not fixed
    and may change during the interaction. However, it is guaranteed that there exists
    a configuration of $$$a$$$ working batteries that is consistent with the information
    that you have received so far.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
    test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n
    \le 40$$$) — the number of batteries.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200$$$.

    Interaction

    The interaction for each test case begins with reading the integer $$$n$$$.

    To make a query, print a single line with two integers in the following format:

    $$$\mathbb{u}\,\mathbb{v}$$$ ($$$1 \leq u, v \leq n$$$ and $$$u \neq v$$$) — the
    indices of the batteries you want to test.

    After that, read a single integer $$$x$$$ — indicating whether the flashlight
    turned on after inserting those $$$2$$$ batteries. If $$$x=1$$$, the flashlight
    turned on. Otherwise, if $$$x=0$$$, the flashlight did not turn on.

    After finding a pair of batteries that turns the flashlight on, the interaction
    of the test case is considered successful, and it will terminate. After that,
    the interaction continues with the next test case.

    After printing each query do not forget to output the end of line and flush$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$
    the output. Otherwise, you will get

    Idleness limit exceeded

    verdict.

    If, at any interaction step, you read $$$-1$$$ instead of valid data, your solution
    must exit immediately. This means that your solution will receive

    Wrong answer

    because of an invalid query or any other mistake. Failing to exit can result in
    an arbitrary verdict because your solution will continue to read from a closed
    stream.

    Hacks

    Hacks are disabled for this problem.

    $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$To flush, use:

    fflush(stdout)

    or

    cout.flush()

    in C++;

    sys.stdout.flush()

    in Python;

    see the documentation for other languages.

    Note

    In the first test, there are $$$3$$$ batteries. Only batteries $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$
    work. Therefore, $$$a=2$$$ and we have to find a pair of batteries that work in
    $$$\lfloor \frac{n^2}{a} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{3^2}{2} \rfloor = 4$$$ queries.

    The interaction proceeds as follows:

    The jury responds that they don''t.

    $$$2$$$   $$$3$$$

    $$$1$$$

    The solution asks whether batteries $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ turn the flashlight on.
    The jury responds that they do. A pair of batteries that work is found, so the
    interaction of the first test case terminates successfully.

    In the second test case, there are $$$10$$$ batteries. Only batteries $$$1$$$,
    $$$4$$$, $$$6$$$ and $$$9$$$ work. Therefore, $$$a=4$$$ and we have to find a
    pair of batteries that work in $$$\lfloor \frac{n^2}{a} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{10^2}{4}
    \rfloor = 25$$$ queries.

    The interaction proceeds as follows:

    standard output

    A permutation of length $$$n$$$ is an array of $$$n$$$ integers, where each number
    from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. An

    inversion

    in a permutation $$$p$$$ is a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$
    and $$$p_i > p_j$$$.

    For a permutation $$$p$$$, we define its

    inversion value

    as the number of its subsegments that contain at least one inversion. Formally,
    this is the number of pairs of integers $$$(l, r)$$$ ($$$1 \le l < r \le n$$$)
    for which there exists a pair of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ satisfying the following
    conditions: $$$l \le i < j \le r$$$ and $$$p_i > p_j$$$.

    For example, for the permutation $$$[3, 1, 4, 2]$$$, the inversion value is $$$5$$$.

    You are given two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$. Your task is to construct a permutation
    of length $$$n$$$ with an

    inversion value equal to exactly $$$k$$$

    .

    Input

    The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number
    of test cases.

    Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$
    ($$$2 \le n \le 30$$$; $$$0 \le k \le \dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$$$).

    Output

    For each test case, output the answer as follows:

    if the desired permutation does not exist, output a single integer $$$0$$$;

    otherwise, output $$$n$$$ distinct integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ — the desired
    permutation. If there are multiple such permutations, you may output any of them.

    Imagine that you are the owner of a store. Before the start of a new season, you
    decided to clear your store of leftover goods, and therefore you decided to hold
    a total sale.

    You have $$$n$$$ different items in your store: the $$$i$$$-th item costs $$$c_i$$$
    coins. Each item has a price tag with the corresponding price $$$c_i$$$. You decided
    to hold a sale in the format: "we divided all the prices $$$x$$$ times." Formally,
    this means that you choose a common coefficient $$$x$$$, and during the sale,
    the $$$i$$$-th item will cost $$$\left\lceil \frac{c_i}{x} \right\rceil$$$ coins
    (where $$$\left\lceil y \right\rceil$$$ denotes rounding up).

    To avoid confusion among the customers, you need to pin new price tags with new
    prices on all items, but printing new price tags is costly. Specifically, each
    printed price tag will cost you $$$y$$$ coins.

    Therefore, you had a brilliant idea — why not use the existing price tags and
    simply repin them on other items? So, you''ll need to print price tags only for
    those items that do not have a corresponding price tag available.

    There remains one last question: by how much should you reduce the prices, or
    what $$$x$$$ should you choose? The coefficient $$$x$$$ must be an

    integer

    strictly greater

    than $$$1$$$ and such that the total income is maximized. The total income is
    equal to the total value of the items minus the cost of the printed price tags.

    Determine the maximum possible total income.

    Input

    The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10$$$) — the
    number of test cases.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1
    \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le y \le 10^9$$$) — the number of items and the
    cost of printing one price tag.

    The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$$$ ($$$1 \le
    c_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the initial prices of the items.

    Output

    For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total income.

    Note

    In the first test case, it is optimal to choose $$$x = 3$$$. The new prices of
    the items will be $$$[17, 50, 17, 50, 50]$$$. In this case, we can use two old
    price tags of $$$50$$$, and we will have to print three price tags for $$$17$$$,
    $$$17$$$, and $$$50$$$. As a result, the income will be $$$17 + 50 + 17 + 50 +
    50 - 51 \cdot 3 = 31$$$.

    In the second test case, it is optimal to choose $$$x = 2$$$. The new prices will
    be $$$[21, 21, 21]$$$, and we will have to print $$$3$$$ new price tags.

    In the third test case, it is optimal to choose $$$x = 111$$$.

    In the fourth test case, it is optimal to choose $$$x = 2$$$. The new prices will
    be the same as the old ones, so no new price tags will be printed.'

    from the root to the vertex. More formally, $$$\text{name}_1 = \text{label}_1$$$
    and $$$\text{name}_u = \text{name}_{p_u} + \text{label}_u$$$ for all $$$2\le u\le
    n$$$, where $$$p_u$$$ is the parent of vertex $$$u$$$ and $$$+$$$ represents string
    concatenation.

    The

    beauty

    of the tree is equal to the length of the longest common subsequence$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$
    of the names of all the

    leaves

    $$$^{\text{†}}$$$. Your task is to determine the maximum beauty among all labelings
    of the tree with exactly $$$k$$$ zeros and $$$n - k$$$ ones.

    $$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A sequence $$$a$$$ is a subsequence of a sequence $$$b$$$ if
    $$$a$$$ can be obtained from $$$b$$$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero
    or all) element from arbitrary positions.  The longest common subsequence of strings
    $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots s_m$$$ is the longest string that is a subsequence of all
    of $$$s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_m$$$.

    $$$^{\text{†}}$$$A leaf is any vertex without children.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
    test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 50$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2
    \leq n \leq 1000$$$, $$$0 \leq k \leq n$$$) — the number of vertices and the number
    of vertices labeled with zero, respectively.

    The second line contains $$$n - 1$$$ integers $$$p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_{n}$$$ ($$$1
    \leq p_i \le i - 1$$$) — the parent of vertex $$$i$$$.

    Note that there are

    no constraints

    on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.

    Output

    For each test case, output a single integer representing the maximum beauty among
    all labelings of the tree with exactly $$$k$$$ zeros and $$$n - k$$$ ones.

    Heartfall River runs horizontally through Destinyland and divides it into the
    northern and southern sides.

    Engineer Root wants to build $$$n$$$ houses along the river, numbered from $$$1$$$
    to $$$n$$$. All houses on the northern side and all houses on the southern side
    must lie along straight lines parallel to Heartfall River.

    There will be $$$m$$$ bridges, with the $$$i$$$-th bridge connecting house $$$u_i$$$
    and house $$$v_i$$$ ($$$u_i \ne v_i$$$). It is guaranteed that all $$$n$$$ houses
    are connected by these bridges, that is, you can travel from any house to any
    other by crossing bridges. Also, there are no two bridges connecting the same
    pair of houses.

    Root wants to know how many ways there are to arrange the $$$n$$$ houses along
    the river, modulo $$$10^9+7$$$, such that the following conditions hold for the
    planned $$$m$$$ bridges:

    For every bridge, the two houses it connects lie on opposite sides of the river;

    The bridges do not cross when drawn as straight lines between the houses.

    A possible arrangement of the houses when $$$n=5$$$.

    Two arrangements are considered different if at least one of the following conditions
    holds:

    There exists a house that lies on a different side in each arrangement;

    There exist two houses $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ that are on the same side in both arrangements,
    but $$$a$$$ comes before $$$b$$$ in one arrangement and $$$b$$$ comes before $$$a$$$
    in the other.

    Since Root is distracted by his ex, whom destiny separated from him, he asks you
    to calculate the number of ways to arrange the houses along the river, modulo
    $$$10^9+7$$$.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of

    and $$$v_i$$$ ($$$1 \leq u_i,v_i \leq n$$$, $$$u_i\ne v_i$$$) — the two houses
    that the $$$i$$$-th bridge connects.

    Aryan and Harshith play a game. They both start with three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$,

    are equal.

    For example, when $$$a=2, b=2, k=6, n=3$$$ and $$$m=3$$$, if Harshith gives Aryan

    .

    Let $$$s_u$$$ denote the sum of $$$a_v$$$ where vertex $$$v$$$ is in the subtree$$$^{\text{†}}$$$
    of vertex $$$u$$$. Yousef considers the tree

    special

    if all the values in $$$s$$$ are

    pairwise distinct

    (i.e., all subtree sums are unique).

    Your task is to help Yousef count the number of different arrays $$$a$$$ that

    Hackers are once again trying to create entertaining phrases using the output
    of neural networks. This time, they want to obtain an array of strings $$$a$$$
    of length $$$n$$$.

    Initially, they have an array $$$c$$$ of length $$$n$$$, filled with blanks, which
    are denoted by the symbol $$$*$$$. Thus, if $$$n=4$$$, then initially $$$c=[*,*,*,*]$$$.

    The hackers have access to $$$m$$$ neural networks, each of which has its own
    version of the answer to their request – an array of strings $$$b_i$$$ of length
    $$$n$$$.

    The hackers are trying to obtain the array $$$a$$$ from the array $$$c$$$ using
    the following operations:

    Choose a neural network $$$i$$$, which will perform the next operation on the
    array $$$c$$$: it will select a

    random

    blank

    , for example, at position $$$j$$$, and replace $$$c_j$$$ with $$$b_{i, j}$$$.

    For example, if the first neural network is chosen and $$$c = [*, \text{«like»},
    *]$$$, and $$$b_1 = [\text{«I»}, \text{«love»}, \text{«apples»}]$$$, then after
    the operation with the first neural network, $$$c$$$ may become either $$$[\text{«I»},
    \text{«like»}, *]$$$ or $$$[*, \text{«like»}, \text{«apples»}]$$$.

    Choose position $$$j$$$ and replace $$$c_j$$$ with a blank.

    Unfortunately, because of the way hackers access neural networks, they will only
    be able to see the modified array $$$c$$$ after all operations are completed,
    so they will have to specify the entire sequence of operations in advance.

    However, the random behavior of the neural networks may lead to the situation
    where the desired array is never obtained, or obtaining it requires an excessive
    number of operations.

    Therefore, the hackers are counting on your help in choosing a sequence of operations
    that will guarantee the acquisition of array $$$a$$$ in the minimum number of
    operations.

    More formally, if there exists a sequence of operations that can

    guarantee

    obtaining array $$$a$$$ from array $$$c$$$, then among all such sequences, find
    the one with the

    minimum

    number of operations, and output the number of operations in it.

    If there is no sequence of operations that transforms array $$$c$$$ into array
    $$$a$$$, then output $$$-1$$$.

    \le n, m \le 500$$$) — the length of the original array $$$a$$$ and the number
    of neural networks, respectively.

    The second line of each test case contains the array $$$a$$$, consisting of $$$n$$$
    strings $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \le |a_i| \le 10$$$), separated by spaces.

    The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case contain the arrays $$$b_i$$$ — one in
    each line, consisting of $$$n$$$ strings $$$b_{i, j}$$$ ($$$1 \le |b_{i,j}| \le
    10$$$), separated by spaces.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$|a_i|$$$ and $$$|b_{i, j}|$$$ across all test
    cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and that the sum of $$$n \cdot m$$$
    across all test cases also does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

    It is guaranteed that the input strings consist only of characters from the Latin
    alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase.

    Note that the length of each individual input string does not exceed $$$10$$$.

    Output

    Output $$$t$$$ numbers — one number for each test case, each on a separate line.

    If there exists a sequence of operations that guarantees obtaining array $$$a$$$
    from the $$$i$$$-th test case, then the $$$i$$$-th number is the number of operations
    in the minimum such sequence.

    Otherwise, for the $$$i$$$-th number, output $$$-1$$$.

    In anticipation of a duel with his old friend Fernan, Edmond is preparing an energy
    drink called "

    Mishkin Energizer

    ". The drink consists of a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, made up only of the
    characters

    L

    ,

    I

    , and

    T

    , which correspond to the content of three different substances in the drink.

    We call the drink

    balanced

    if it contains an equal number of all substances. To boost his aura and ensure
    victory in the duel, Edmond must make the initial string balanced by applying
    the following operation:

    Choose an index $$$i$$$ such that $$$s_i \neq s_{i+1}$$$ (where $$$i + 1$$$ must
    not exceed the

    current

    size of the string).

    Insert a character $$$x$$$, either

    L

    ,

    I

    , or

    T

    , between them such that $$$x \neq s_i$$$ and $$$x \neq s_{i+1}$$$.

    Help Edmond make the drink balanced and win the duel by performing

    no more than $$$\textbf{2n}$$$ operations

    . If there are multiple solutions, any one of them can be output. If it is impossible,
    you must report this.

    Input

    Each test consists of several test cases. The first line of the input data contains
    one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 100$$$) — the number of test cases. The description
    of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le
    100$$$) — the length of the string $$$s$$$.

    The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$,
    consisting only of the characters

    L

    ,

    I

    , and

    T

    .

    Output

    For each test case, output $$$-1$$$ if there is no solution. Otherwise, in the
    first line, output a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le m \le 2n$$$) — the number
    of operations you performed.

    Then the $$$l$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines should contain a single integer
    $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i < n+l-1$$$), indicating the operation of inserting a character
    between $$$s_i$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$. It must hold that $$$s_i \neq s_{i+1}$$$.

    If there are multiple solutions, any one of them can be output. Note that you
    do not need to minimize the number of operations in this problem.

    Consider the following game.

    In this game, a level consists of $$$n$$$ pairs of gates. Each pair contains one
    left gate and one right gate. Each gate performs one of two operations:

    Addition Operation

    (

    + a

    ): Increases the number of people in a lane by a constant amount $$$a$$$.

    Multiplication Operation

    (

    x a

    ): Multiplies the current number of people in a lane by an integer $$$a$$$. This
    means the number of people increases by $$$(a - 1)$$$ times the current count
    in that lane.

    The additional people gained from each operation can be assigned to either lane.
    However, people already in a lane

    cannot

    be moved to the other lane.

    Initially, there is one person in each lane. Your task is to determine the maximum
    total number of people that can be achieved by the end of the level.

    Input

    The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number
    of test cases.

    The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \le
    30$$$) — the number of pairs of gates.

    The next $$$n$$$ lines of each test case provide the information for the left
    gate followed by the right gate of each gate pair. The information for each gate
    is given in the form

    +

    $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \le a \le 1000$$$) or

    x

    $$$a$$$ ($$$2 \le a \le 3$$$) for some integer $$$a$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total number of people
    at the end of the level.

    Note

    In the first case, here is one possible way to play this game optimally.

    Initially, we have $$$l=1$$$ person in the left lane and $$$r=1$$$ person in the
    right lane.

    After passing through the first pair of gates, we gain $$$4$$$ people from the
    left gate and $$$1 \cdot (2-1) = 1$$$ person from the right gate, for a total
    of $$$4+1=5$$$ people. We allocate $$$2$$$ people to the left lane and $$$3$$$
    people to the right lane. This results in $$$l=1+2=3$$$ people in the left lane
    and $$$r=1+3=4$$$ people in the right lane.

    After passing through the second pair of gates, we gain $$$3 \cdot (3-1) = 6$$$
    people from the left gate and $$$4 \cdot (3-1) = 8$$$ people from the right gate,
    for a total of $$$6+8=14$$$ people. We allocate $$$7$$$ people to the left lane
    and $$$7$$$ people to the right lane. This results in $$$l=3+7=10$$$ people in
    the left lane and $$$r=4+7=11$$$ people in the right lane.

    After passing through the last pair of gates, we gain $$$7$$$ people from the
    left gate and $$$4$$$ people from the right gate, for a total of $$$7+4=11$$$
    people. We allocate $$$6$$$ people to the left lane and $$$5$$$ people to the
    right lane. This results in $$$l=10+6=16$$$ people in the left lane and $$$r=11+5=16$$$
    people in the right lane.

    At the end, the total number of people is $$$16+16=32$$$.'

    Alice and Bob participate in a fishing contest! In total, they caught $$$n$$$
    fishes, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (the bigger the fish, the greater its
    index). Some of these fishes were caught by Alice, others — by Bob.

    Their performance will be evaluated as follows. First, an integer $$$m$$$ will
    be chosen, and all fish will be split into $$$m$$$

    non-empty

    groups. The first group should contain several (at least one) smallest fishes,
    the second group — several (at least one) next smallest fishes, and so on. Each
    fish should belong to exactly one group, and each group should be a contiguous
    subsegment of fishes. Note that the groups are numbered in exactly that order;
    for example, the fishes from the second group cannot be smaller than the fishes
    from the first group, since the first group contains the smallest fishes.

    Then, each fish will be assigned a value according to its group index: each fish
    in the first group gets value equal to $$$0$$$, each fish in the second group
    gets value equal to $$$1$$$, and so on. So, each fish in the $$$i$$$-th group
    gets value equal to $$$(i-1)$$$.

    The score of each contestant is simply the total value of all fishes that contestant
    caught.

    You want Bob''s score to exceed Alice''s score by

    at least

    $$$k$$$ points. What is the minimum number of groups ($$$m$$$) you have to split

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2
    \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$).

    The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly $$$n$$$ characters. The

    This is an interactive problem.

    Upon clearing the Waterside Area, Gretel has found a monster named Genokraken,
    and she''s keeping it contained for her scientific studies.

    The monster''s nerve system can be structured as a tree$$$^{\dagger}$$$ of $$$n$$$
    nodes

    (really, everything should stop resembling trees all the time$$$\ldots$$$)

    , numbered from $$$0$$$ to $$$n-1$$$, with node $$$0$$$ as the root.

    Gretel''s objective is to learn the exact structure of the monster''s nerve system —
    more specifically, she wants to know the values $$$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}$$$
    of the tree, where $$$p_i$$$ ($$$0 \le p_i < i$$$) is the direct parent node of
    node $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \le i \le n - 1$$$).

    She doesn''t know exactly how the nodes are placed, but she knows a few convenient
    facts:

    If we remove root node $$$0$$$ and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into
    a forest consisting of only paths$$$^{\ddagger}$$$. Each node that was initially
    adjacent to the node $$$0$$$

    will be the end of some path

    .

    The nodes are indexed in a way that if $$$1 \le x \le y \le n - 1$$$, then $$$p_x
    \le p_y$$$.

    Node $$$1$$$ has

    exactly two

    adjacent nodes (including the node $$$0$$$).

    The tree in this picture

    does not

    satisfy the condition, because if we remove node $$$0$$$, then node $$$2$$$ (which
    was initially adjacent to the node $$$0$$$) will not be the end of the path $$$4-2-5$$$.

    The tree in this picture

    does not

    satisfy the condition, because $$$p_3 \le p_4$$$ must hold.

    The tree in this picture

    does not

    satisfy the condition, because node $$$1$$$ has only one adjacent node.

    Gretel can make queries to the containment cell:

    "

    ? a b

    " ($$$1 \le a, b < n$$$, $$$a \ne b$$$) — the cell will check if the simple path
    between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ contains the node $$$0$$$.

    However, to avoid unexpected consequences by overstimulating the creature, Gretel
    wants to query at most $$$2n - 6$$$ times. Though Gretel is gifted, she can''t
    do everything all at once, so can you give her a helping hand?

    $$$^{\dagger}$$$A tree is a connected graph where every pair of distinct nodes
    has exactly one simple path connecting them.

    $$$^{\ddagger}$$$A path is a tree whose vertices can be listed in the order $$$v_1,
    v_2, \ldots, v_k$$$ such that the edges are $$$(v_i, v_{i+1})$$$ ($$$1 \le i <
    k$$$).

    Input

    Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
    $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of
    the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \le n
    \le 10^4$$$) — the number of nodes in Genokraken''s nerve system.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^4$$$.

    Interaction

    For each test case, interaction starts by reading the integer $$$n$$$.

    Then you can make queries of the following type:

    "

    ? a b

    " (without quotes) ($$$1 \le a, b < n$$$, $$$a \ne b$$$).

    After the query, read an integer $$$r$$$ — the answer to your query. You are allowed
    to use at most $$$2n - 6$$$ queries of this type.

    If the simple path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ does not contain node $$$0$$$,
    you will get $$$r = 0$$$.

    If the simple path between nodes $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ contains node $$$0$$$, you
    will get $$$r = 1$$$.

    In case you make more than $$$2n-6$$$ queries or make an invalid query, you will
    get $$$r = -1$$$. You will need to terminate after this to get the "

    Wrong answer

    " verdict. Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
    continue to read from a closed stream.

    When you find out the structure, output a line in the format "

    !

    $$$p_1 \space p_2 \ldots p_{n-1}$$$" (without quotes), where $$$p_i$$$ ($$$0 \le
    p_i < i$$$) denotes the index of the direct parent of node $$$i$$$. This query
    is not counted towards the $$$2n - 6$$$ queries limit.

    After solving one test case, the program should immediately move on to the next
    one. After solving all test cases, the program should be terminated immediately.

    After printing any query do not forget to output an end of line and flush the
    output buffer. Otherwise, you will get

    Idleness limit exceeded

    . To do this, use:

    fflush(stdout)

    or

    cout.flush()

    in C++;

    System.out.flush()

    in Java;

    flush(output)

    in Pascal;

    stdout.flush()

    in Python;

    see documentation for other languages.

    The interactor is

    non-adaptive

    . The tree

    does not change

    during the interaction.

    Hacks

    For hack, use the following format:

    The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the

    If we remove root node $$$0$$$ and all adjacent edges, this tree will turn into
    a forest consisting of only paths. Each node that was initially adjacent to the
    node $$$0$$$ will be the end of some path.

    Node $$$1$$$ has exactly two adjacent nodes (including the node $$$0$$$).

    One fine evening, Alice sat down to play the classic game "Connect the Dots",
    but with a twist.

    To play the game, Alice draws a straight line and marks $$$n$$$ points on it,
    indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. Initially, there are no arcs between the points,
    so they are all disjoint. After that, Alice performs $$$m$$$ operations of the
    following type:

    She picks three integers $$$a_i$$$, $$$d_i$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i \le 10$$$), and $$$k_i$$$.

    She selects points $$$a_i, a_i+d_i, a_i+2d_i, a_i+3d_i, \ldots, a_i+k_i\cdot d_i$$$
    and connects each pair of these points with arcs.

    After performing all $$$m$$$ operations, she wants to know the number of connected
    components$$$^\dagger$$$ these points form. Please help her find this number.

    $$$^\dagger$$$ Two points are said to be in one connected component if there is
    a path between them via several (possibly zero) arcs and other points.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
    test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^5$$$). The description of the test cases
    follows.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1
    \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

    The $$$i$$$-th of the following $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$a_i$$$,
    $$$d_i$$$, and $$$k_i$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le a_i + k_i\cdot d_i \le n$$$, $$$1 \le

    single-point connected components. Thus, the answer is $$$1 + 95 = 96$$$.

    In the third test case, there are $$$n = 100$$$ points. After the operations,
    all odd points from $$$1$$$ to $$$79$$$ will be in one connected component of

    In the humble act of meeting, joy doth unfold like a flower in bloom.

    Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Marian sold her last ware at the Market at
    the same time Robin finished training at the Major Oak. They couldn''t wait to
    meet, so they both start without delay.

    The travel network is represented as $$$n$$$ vertices numbered from $$$1$$$ to
    $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ edges. The $$$i$$$-th edge connects vertices $$$u_i$$$ and
    $$$v_i$$$, and takes $$$w_i$$$ seconds to travel (all $$$w_i$$$ are even). Marian
    starts at vertex $$$1$$$ (Market) and Robin starts at vertex $$$n$$$ (Major Oak).

    In addition, $$$h$$$ of the $$$n$$$ vertices each has a single horse available.
    Both Marian and Robin are capable riders, and could mount horses in no time (i.e.
    in $$$0$$$ seconds). Travel times are halved when riding. Once mounted, a horse
    lasts the remainder of the travel. Meeting must take place on a vertex (i.e. not
    on an edge). Either could choose to wait on any vertex.

    Output the earliest time Robin and Marian can meet. If vertices $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$
    are disconnected, output $$$-1$$$ as the meeting is cancelled.

    Input

    The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\leq t \leq

    that have a single horse.

    The second line of each test case contains $$$h$$$ distinct integers $$$a_1, a_2,

    $$$w_i$$$ seconds without a horse.

    There are no self loops or multiple edges. By good fortune, all $$$w_i$$$ are

    standard output

    Narek is too lazy to create the third problem of this contest. His friend Artur
    suggests that he should use ChatGPT. ChatGPT creates $$$n$$$ problems, each consisting
    of $$$m$$$ letters, so Narek has $$$n$$$ strings. To make the problem harder,
    he combines the problems by selecting some of the $$$n$$$ strings

    possibly none

    and concatenating them

    without altering their order

    . His chance of solving the problem is defined as $$$score_n - score_c$$$, where
    $$$score_n$$$ is Narek''s score and $$$score_c$$$ is ChatGPT''s score.

    Narek calculates $$$score_n$$$ by examining the selected string (he moves from
    left to right). He initially searches for the letter $$$\texttt{"n"}$$$, followed
    by $$$\texttt{"a"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"r"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"e"}$$$, and $$$\texttt{"k"}$$$.
    Upon finding all occurrences of these letters, he increments $$$score_n$$$ by
    $$$5$$$ and resumes searching for $$$\texttt{"n"}$$$ again (he doesn''t go back,
    and he just continues from where he left off).

    After Narek finishes, ChatGPT scans through the array and increments $$$score_c$$$
    by $$$1$$$ for each letter $$$\texttt{"n"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"a"}$$$, $$$\texttt{"r"}$$$,
    $$$\texttt{"e"}$$$, or $$$\texttt{"k"}$$$ that Narek fails to utilize (note that
    if Narek fails to complete the last occurrence by finding all of the $$$5$$$ letters,
    then all of the letters he used are counted in ChatGPT''s score $$$score_c$$$,
    and Narek doesn''t get any points if he doesn''t finish finding all the 5 letters).

    Narek aims to maximize the value of $$$score_n - score_c$$$ by selecting the most
    optimal subset of the initial strings.

    Input

    In the first line of the input, you''re given a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le
    t \le 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case
    follows.

    In the first line of each test case, you''re given two integers $$$n, m$$$ ($$$1
    \le n, m \le 10^3$$$), the number of strings and the length of each string.

    In the next $$$n$$$ lines, you''re given $$$n$$$ strings, each having a length
    of $$$m$$$. The strings only contain lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

    The sum of values of $$$n \cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$10^6$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, output a single integer: the maximal possible value of $$$score_n
    - score_c$$$.

    Note

    In the first test case, one of the optimal answers is when Narek doesn''t choose
    any of the strings, so the answer is $$$0$$$. He can alternatively choose all
    the strings. In this case, the full string becomes "nnaarreekk". Narek can choose
    the first appearances of all letters and add $$$5$$$ to the score. His opponent
    will add $$$1$$$ for all second appearances, which will be $$$5$$$ in total. So
    the answer will be $$$5 - 5 = 0$$$.

    In the third test case, the only optimal answer is when Narek doesn''t choose
    the string. Note that if he were to choose the string, he wouldn''t be able to
    find the last letter "k", so his score would stay at $$$0$$$ instead of becoming
    $$$5$$$. Then ChatGPT would add $$$4$$$ for all of the $$$4$$$ letters, and the
    answer would become $$$0 - 4 = -4$$$.

    In the last test case, Narek needs to choose the first and the last strings. After
    putting these two next to each other, he gets "$$${\color{red}{n}}rr{\color{red}{a}}{\color{red}{r}}{\color{red}{e}}{\color{red}{k}}{\color{red}{n}}k{\color{red}{a}}{\color{red}{r}}{\color{red}{e}}{\color{red}{k}}{\color{blue}{z}}$$$".
    Narek can choose the letters marked with red and add $$$10$$$ to his score. Since
    the black colored letters Narek left behind are eligible for the opponent to claim
    (they are used in the word "narek"), the opponent adds all other letters to the
    score and gets a score of $$$3$$$. Therefore, the answer is $$$10 - 3 = 7$$$.'

    be seen as an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ nodes and $$$m$$$ edges. Edge $$$i$$$
    connects cities $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$ and has a length of $$$w_i$$$.

    Slavic doesn''t have a bike, but what he has is money. Every city has exactly
    one bike for sale. The bike in the $$$i$$$-th city has a slowness factor of $$$s_{i}$$$.
    Once Slavic buys a bike, he can use it

    This is the hard version of the problem. The only differences between the two
    versions of this problem are the constraints on $$$n$$$ and the time limit. You
    can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

    You are given two arrays $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ of length $$$n$$$.

    You can perform the following operation some (possibly zero) times:

    choose $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ such that $$$1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$$$.

    let $$$x=\max(a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r)$$$.

    for all $$$l \leq i \leq r$$$, set $$$a_i := x$$$.

    Determine if you can make array $$$a$$$ equal to array $$$b$$$.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$
    ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the
    test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n
    \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the arrays.

    The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le
    a_i \le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$a$$$.

    The third line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le
    b_i \le n$$$) — the elements of array $$$b$$$.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2
    \cdot 10^5$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, output "

    YES

    " (without quotes) if you can make $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$ using any number of operations,
    and "

    NO

    " (without quotes) otherwise.

    You can output "

    martian

    if it is

    a non-negative integer

    and

    strictly less than

    $$$2^k$$$, for example, when $$$k = 12$$$, the numbers $$$51$$$, $$$1960$$$, $$$0$$$
    are

    martian

    , and the numbers $$$\pi$$$, $$$-1$$$, $$$\frac{21}{8}$$$, $$$4096$$$ are not.

    The aliens will give Lisa $$$n$$$

    martian

    numbers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$. Then they will ask her to name any

    martian

    number $$$x$$$. After that, Lisa will select a pair of numbers $$$a_i, a_j$$$
    ($$$i \neq j$$$) in the given sequence and count $$$(a_i \oplus x) \& (a_j \oplus
    x)$$$. The operation $$$\oplus$$$ means

    Bitwise exclusive OR

    , the operation $$$\&$$$ means

    Bitwise And

    . For example, $$$(5 \oplus 17) \& (23 \oplus 17) = (00101_2 \oplus 10001_2) \&
    (10111_2 \oplus 10001_2) = 10100_2 \& 00110_2 = 00100_2 = 4$$$.

    Lisa is sure that the higher the calculated value, the higher her chances of returning
    home. Help the girl choose such $$$i, j, x$$$ that maximize the calculated value.

    Input

    The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — number of

    You are developing a rating system for an online game. Every time a player participates
    in a match, the player''s rating changes depending on the results.

    Initially, the player''s rating is $$$0$$$. There are $$$n$$$ matches; after the
    $$$i$$$-th match, the rating change is equal to $$$a_i$$$ (the rating increases
    by $$$a_i$$$ if $$$a_i$$$ is positive, or decreases by $$$|a_i|$$$ if it''s negative.
    There are no zeros in the sequence $$$a$$$).

    The system has an additional rule: for a fixed integer $$$k$$$, if a player''s
    rating has reached the value $$$k$$$, it will never fall below it. Formally, if
    a player''s rating at least $$$k$$$, and a rating change would make it less than
    $$$k$$$, then the rating will decrease

    to exactly $$$k$$$

    .

    Your task is to determine the value $$$k$$$ in such a way that the player''s rating
    after all $$$n$$$ matches is the maximum possible (among all integer values of
    $$$k$$$). If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them.

    Input

    The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the
    number of test cases.

    The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n
    \le 3 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of matches.

    The second line contains $$$n$$$ integer $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9
    \le a_i \le 10^9$$$; $$$a_i \ne 0$$$) — the rating change after the $$$i$$$-th
    match.

    The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn''t exceed $$$3 \cdot 10^5$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, print one integer $$$m$$$ ($$$-10^{18} \le m \le 10^{18}$$$) —
    the value of $$$k$$$ such that the rating of the player will be the maximum possible
    when using this value. It can be shown that at least one of the optimal answers
    meets the constraint $$$-10^{18} \le m \le 10^{18}$$$.

    A Ranom number is a sequence of Ranom digits. The value of the Ranom number is
    calculated as follows: the values of all digits are summed up, but some digits
    are taken with negative signs: a digit is taken with negative sign if there is
    a digit with a

    strictly greater

    value to the right of it (not necessarily immediately after it); otherwise, that
    digit is taken with a positive sign.

    For example, the value of the Ranom number

    has vertices $$$1$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, and two more components contain one
    vertex each. When $$$k=4$$$ or $$$k=5$$$ each vertex is a separate component.'

    Little Sasha has two friends, whom he wants to please with gifts on the Eighth
    of March. To do this, he went to the largest shopping center in the city.

    There are $$$n$$$ departments in the mall, each of which has exactly two stores.
    For convenience, we number the departments with integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.
    It is known that gifts in the first store of the $$$i$$$ department cost $$$a_i$$$
    rubles, and in the second store of the $$$i$$$ department — $$$b_i$$$ rubles.

    Entering the mall, Sasha will visit each of the $$$n$$$ departments of the mall,
    and in each department, he will enter exactly one store. When Sasha gets into
    the $$$i$$$-th department, he will perform exactly one of two actions:

    Buy a gift for the first friend, spending $$$a_i$$$ rubles on it.

    Buy a gift for the second friend, spending $$$b_i$$$ rubles on it.

    Sasha is going to buy at least one gift for each friend. Moreover, he wants to
    pick up gifts in such a way that the price difference of the most expensive gifts
    bought for friends is as small as possible so that no one is offended.

    More formally: let $$$m_1$$$  be the maximum price of a gift bought to the first
    friend, and $$$m_2$$$  be the maximum price of a gift bought to the second friend.
    Sasha wants to choose gifts in such a way as to minimize the value of $$$\lvert
    m_1 - m_2 \rvert$$$.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
    test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1\,000$$$). The description of the test cases
    follows.

    The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n
    \le 500\,000$$$) — the number of departments in the mall.

    Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines of each test case contains two integers $$$a_i$$$
    and $$$b_i$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9$$$) — the prices of gifts in the first
    and second store of the $$$i$$$ department, respectively.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500\,000$$$.

    Output

    Print one integer — the minimum price difference of the most expensive gifts bought
    to friends.

    This is an interactive problem.

    Kira has a hidden positive integer $$$n$$$, and Hayato needs to guess it.

    Initially, Kira gives Hayato the value $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit
    bits in the binary notation of $$$n$$$. To guess $$$n$$$, Hayato can only do operations
    of one kind: choose an integer $$$x$$$ and subtract it from $$$n$$$. Note that
    after each operation, the number $$$n$$$

    changes

    . Kira doesn''t like bad requests, so if Hayato tries to subtract a number $$$x$$$
    greater than $$$n$$$, he will lose to Kira. After each operation, Kira gives Hayato
    the updated value $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the number of unit bits in the binary notation
    of the updated value of $$$n$$$.

    Kira doesn''t have much patience, so Hayato must guess the

    original

    value of $$$n$$$ after no more than $$$30$$$ operations.

    Since Hayato is in elementary school, he asks for your help. Write a program that
    guesses the number $$$n$$$. Kira is an honest person, so he chooses the initial
    number $$$n$$$ before all operations and

    does not

    change it afterward.

    Input

    The input data contains several test cases. The first line contains one integer
    $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 500$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of
    the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains the number $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$ — the
    initial number of unit bits in the binary notation $$$n$$$.

    The hidden integer $$$n$$$ satisfies the following constraint: $$$1 \le n \le
    10^9$$$.

    Interaction

    To guess $$$n$$$, you can perform the operation at most $$$30$$$ times. To do
    that, print a line with the following format: "

    - x

    " ($$$1 \le x \le 10^9$$$).

    After this operation, the number $$$x$$$ is subtracted from $$$n$$$, and therefore
    $$$n$$$

    is changed

    . If the number $$$x$$$ is greater than the current value of $$$n$$$, then the
    request is considered invalid.

    After the operation read a line containing a single non-negative integer $$$\mathrm{cnt}$$$
    — the number of unit bits in the binary notation of the current $$$n$$$ after
    the operation.

    When you know the

    initial

    value of $$$n$$$, print one line in the following format: "

    ! n

    " ($$$1 \le n \le 10^9$$$).

    After that, move on to the next test case, or terminate the program if there are
    none.

    If your program performs more than $$$30$$$ operations for one test case, subtracts
    a number $$$x$$$ greater than $$$n$$$, or makes an incorrect request, then

    response to the request will be

    -1

    , after receiving such response, your program must exit immediately to receive
    the

    Wrong Answer

    verdict. Otherwise, you can get any other verdict.

    After printing a query or the answer, do not forget to output the end of line
    and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get

    Idleness limit exceeded

    . To do this, use:

    fflush(stdout)

    or

    cout.flush()

    in C++;

    System.out.flush()

    in Java;

    flush(output)

    in Pascal;

    stdout.flush()

    in Python;

    see documentation for other languages.

    Hacks

    To make a hack, use the following format.

    The first line should contain a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 500$$$).

    Each test case should contain one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 10^9$$$) on
    a separate line.

    Note

    For example, the number of unit bits in number $$$6$$$ is $$$2$$$, because binary
    notation of $$$6$$$ is $$$110$$$. For $$$13$$$ the number of unit bits is $$$3$$$,
    because $$$13_{10} = 1101_2$$$.

    In the first test case, $$$n = 1$$$, so the input is the number $$$1$$$. After
    subtracting one from $$$n$$$, it becomes zero, so the number of unit bits in it
    is $$$0$$$.

    In the third test case, $$$n = 3$$$, which in binary representation looks like
    $$$3_{10} = 11_2$$$, so the input is the number of ones, that is $$$2$$$. After
    subtracting $$$2$$$, $$$n = 1$$$, so the number of unit bits is now $$$1$$$. After
    subtracting one from $$$n$$$, it becomes equal to zero.

    Note that the blank lines in the input and output examples are shown for clarity
    and are not present in the actual interaction.'

    Mars is home to an unusual species of spiders — Binary spiders.

    Right now, Martian scientists are observing a colony of $$$n$$$ spiders, the $$$i$$$-th
    of which has $$$a_i$$$ legs.

    Some of the spiders are friends with each other. Namely, the $$$i$$$-th and $$$j$$$-th
    spiders are friends if $$$\gcd(a_i, a_j) \ne 1$$$, i. e., there is some integer
    $$$k \ge 2$$$ such that $$$a_i$$$ and $$$a_j$$$ are simultaneously divided by
    $$$k$$$ without a remainder. Here $$$\gcd(x, y)$$$ denotes the

    greatest common divisor (GCD)

    of integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$.

    Scientists have discovered that spiders can send messages. If two spiders are
    friends, then they can transmit a message directly in one second. Otherwise, the
    spider must pass the message to his friend, who in turn must pass the message
    to his friend, and so on until the message reaches the recipient.

    Let''s look at an example.

    Suppose a spider with eight legs wants to send a message to a spider with $$$15$$$
    legs. He can''t do it directly, because $$$\gcd(8, 15) = 1$$$. But he can send
    a message through the spider with six legs because $$$\gcd(8, 6) = 2$$$ and $$$\gcd(6,
    15) = 3$$$. Thus, the message will arrive in two seconds.

    Right now, scientists are observing how the $$$s$$$-th spider wants to send a
    message to the $$$t$$$-th spider. The researchers have a hypothesis that spiders
    always transmit messages optimally. For this reason, scientists would need a program
    that could calculate the minimum time to send a message and also deduce one of
    the optimal routes.

    Input

    The first line of input contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 3\cdot10^5$$$) —
    the number of spiders in the colony.

    The second line of input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$
    ($$$1 \le a_i \le 3\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of legs the spiders have.

    The third line of input contains two integers $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le s,
    t \le n$$$) —the spiders between which the message must be sent.

    Output

    If it is impossible to transmit a message between the given pair of spiders, print
    $$$-1$$$.

    Otherwise, in the first line of the output print the integer $$$t$$$ ($$$t \ge
    1$$$) — the number of spiders that participate in the message transmission (i. e.
    the minimum time of message delivery in seconds plus one). In the second line,
    print $$$t$$$ different integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_t$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le
    n$$$) — the ids of the spiders through which the message should follow, in order
    from sender to receiver.

    If there are several optimal routes for the message, output any of them.

    Note

    The first example is shown above. It shows that the message from the $$$5$$$-th
    spider (with eight legs) to the $$$6$$$-th spider (with $$$15$$$ legs) is optimal
    to pass through the $$$4$$$-th spider (with six legs).

    In the second example, the spider number $$$7$$$ (with $$$11$$$ legs) is not friends
    with anyone, so it is impossible to send him a message.'

    You are playing a game called

    Slime Escape

    . The game takes place on a number line. Initially, there are $$$n$$$ slimes.
    For all positive integers $$$i$$$ where $$$1 \le i \le n$$$, the $$$i$$$-th slime
    is located at position $$$i$$$ and has health $$$a_i$$$. You are controlling the
    slime at position $$$k$$$.

    There are two escapes located at positions $$$0$$$ and $$$n+1$$$. Your goal is
    to reach

    any one

    of the two escapes by performing any number of game moves.

    In one game move, you move your slime to the left or right by one position. However,
    if there is another slime in the new position, you must absorb it. When absorbing
    a slime, the health of your slime would be increased by the health of the absorbed
    slime, then the absorbed slime would be removed from the game.

    Note that some slimes might have negative health, so your health would decrease
    when absorbing such slimes.

    You lose the game immediately if your slime has negative health at any moment
    during the game.

    Can you reach one of two escapes by performing any number of game moves, without
    ever losing the game?

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
    $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 20\,000$$$) — the number of test cases. Description
    of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$
    ($$$3 \leq n \leq 200\,000$$$, $$$1 \leq k \leq n$$$) — the number of slimes and
    the position of your slime.

    The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots,
    a_n$$$ ($$$-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$$$) — the health of the slimes.

    It is guaranteed that health of your slime is non-negative ($$$a_k \geq 0$$$),
    and all other slimes have non-zero health ($$$a_i \ne 0$$$ for $$$i \ne k$$$).

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$200\,000$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, print "

    YES

    NO

    " (without quotes) otherwise.

    Note

    In the first test case, you control the slime at position $$$4$$$ with health
    $$$6$$$. One way to escape is to absorb the slimes at positions $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$,
    and $$$7$$$. Your slime escapes with $$$0$$$ health at position $$$8$$$.

    In the second test case, you control the slime with $$$232$$$ health at position
    $$$1$$$. Since your slime is already located next to the escape at position $$$0$$$,
    you can move to it without absorbing any slime.

    In the third test case, it can be shown that your slime would always have a negative
    health before reaching any one of two escapes.

    In the fourth test case, you control the slime at position $$$4$$$ with health
    $$$6$$$. The following describes a possible sequence of moves to win:

    Absorb the slimes at positions $$$5$$$, $$$6$$$, and $$$7$$$: your health becomes
    $$$4$$$ after absorbing the slime with health $$$-2$$$; becomes $$$1$$$ after
    absorbing the slime with health $$$-3$$$; and becomes $$$7$$$ after absorbing
    the slime with health $$$6$$$.

    Absorb the slimes at positions $$$3$$$, and $$$2$$$: your health becomes $$$7-7+10=10$$$.

    Absorb the slime at position $$$8$$$: your health becomes $$$10-10=0$$$.

    Use the escape at position $$$9$$$.

    Since your slime has maintained non-negative health at all times, you have won.'

    We hid from you a cyclic graph of $$$n$$$ vertices ($$$3 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$).
    A cyclic graph is an undirected graph of $$$n$$$ vertices that form one cycle.
    Each vertex belongs to the cycle, i.e. the length of the cycle (the number of
    edges in it) is exactly $$$n$$$. The order of the vertices in the cycle is arbitrary.

    You can make queries in the following way:

    "

    ? a b

    " where $$$1 \le a, b \le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$a \neq b$$$. In response to the query,
    the interactor outputs on a separate line the length of random of two paths from
    vertex $$$a$$$ to vertex $$$b$$$, or

    -1

    if $$$\max(a, b) > n$$$. The interactor chooses one of the two paths with

    equal probability

    . The length of the path —is the number of edges in it.

    You win if you guess the number of vertices in the hidden graph (number $$$n$$$)
    by making no more than $$$50$$$ queries.

    Note that the interactor is implemented in such a way that for any ordered pair
    $$$(a, b)$$$, it always returns the same value for query "

    ? a b

    ", no matter how many such queries. Note that the "

    ? b a

    " query may be answered differently by the interactor.

    The vertices in the graph are randomly placed, and their positions are fixed in
    advance.

    Hacks are forbidden in this problem. The number of tests the jury has is $$$50$$$.

    Interaction

    You can make no more than $$$50$$$ of queries. To make a query, output on a separate
    line:

    "

    ? a b

    ", where $$$1 \le a, b \le 10^{18}$$$ and $$$a \neq b$$$. In response to the query,
    the interactor will output on a separate line the length of a random simple path
    from vertex $$$a$$$ to vertex $$$b$$$ (not to be confused with the path from $$$b$$$
    to $$$a$$$), or $$$-1$$$ if $$$\max(a, b) > n$$$. The interactor chooses one of
    the two paths with

    equal probability

    .

    If your program gets a number

    0

    as a result of a query, it means that the verdict for your solution is already
    defined as "

    wrong answer

    " (for example, you made more than $$$50$$$ queries or made an invalid query).
    In this case, your program should terminate immediately. Otherwise, in this scenario
    you may get a random verdict "

    Execution error

    ", "

    Exceeded time limit

    " or some other verdict instead of "

    Wrong answer

    ".

    The answer, like queries, print on a separate line. The output of the answer is
    not counted as a query when counting them. To print it, use the following format:

    "

    ! n

    ": the expected size of the hidden graph ($$$3 \le n \le 10^{18}$$$).

    After that, your program should terminate.

    After the output of the next query, be sure to use stream cleaning functions so
    that some of your output is not left in some buffer. For example, in C++ you should
    use function

    flush(stdout)

    , in Java call

    System.out.flush()

    , in Pascal

    flush(output)

    and

    stdout.flush()

    for Python.

    Note that the interactor is implemented in such a way that for any ordered pair
    $$$(a, b)$$$, it always returns the same value for query "

    ? a b

    ", no matter how many such queries. Note that the "

    The first query finds out that one of the simple paths from vertex $$$1$$$ to
    vertex $$$2$$$ has a length of $$$1$$$.

    With the second query, we find out that one of the simple paths from vertex $$$1$$$
    to vertex $$$3$$$ has length $$$2$$$.

    input

    standard input

    standard output

    This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions
    is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.

    Tokitsukaze has a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of
    zeros and ones, $$$n$$$ is

    even

    .

    Now Tokitsukaze divides $$$s$$$ into

    the minimum number

    of

    contiguous

    subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same.
    After that, $$$s$$$ is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.

    For example, if $$$s$$$ is "

    11001111

    ", it will be divided into "

    11

    ", "

    00

    " and "

    1111

    ". Their lengths are $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ respectively, which are all even
    numbers, so "

    11001111

    " is good. Another example, if $$$s$$$ is "

    1110011000

    ", it will be divided into "

    111

    ", "

    00

    ", "

    11

    " and "

    000

    ", and their lengths are $$$3$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$. Obviously, "

    1110011000

    " is not good.

    Tokitsukaze wants to make $$$s$$$ good by changing the values of some positions
    in $$$s$$$. Specifically, she can perform the operation any number of times: change
    the value of $$$s_i$$$ to ''

    0

    '' or ''

    1

    '' ($$$1 \leq i \leq n$$$). Can you tell her the minimum number of operations
    to make $$$s$$$ good?

    Meanwhile, she also wants to know the minimum number of subsegments that $$$s$$$
    can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.

    Input

    The first contains a single positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$$$) —
    the number of test cases.

    For each test case, the first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \leq
    n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$s$$$, it is guaranteed that $$$n$$$
    is even.

    The second line contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting
    only of zeros and ones.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2
    \cdot 10^5$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, print a single line with two integers — the minimum number
    of operations to make $$$s$$$ good, and the minimum number of subsegments that
    $$$s$$$ can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.

    Note

    In the first test case, one of the ways to make $$$s$$$ good is the following.

    Change $$$s_3$$$, $$$s_6$$$ and $$$s_7$$$ to ''

    0

    '', after that $$$s$$$ becomes "

    1100000000

    ", it can be divided into "

    11

    " and "

    00000000

    ", which lengths are $$$2$$$ and $$$8$$$ respectively, the number of subsegments
    of it is $$$2$$$. There are other ways to operate $$$3$$$ times to make $$$s$$$
    good, such as "

    1111110000

    ", "

    1100001100

    ", "

    1111001100

    ", the number of subsegments of them are $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$, $$$4$$$ respectively.
    It''s easy to find that the minimum number of subsegments among all solutions
    with the minimum number of operations is $$$2$$$.

    In the second, third and fourth test cases, $$$s$$$ is good initially, so no operation
    is required.'

    Note

    In the first test case it is easy to see that the array is integral:

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{1}{1} \right \rfloor = 1$$$, $$$a_1 = 1$$$, this number
    occurs in the arry

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right \rfloor = 1$$$

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{5}{5} \right \rfloor = 1$$$

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{2}{1} \right \rfloor = 2$$$, $$$a_2 = 2$$$, this number
    occurs in the array

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{5}{1} \right \rfloor = 5$$$, $$$a_3 = 5$$$, this number
    occurs in the array

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{5}{2} \right \rfloor = 2$$$, $$$a_2 = 2$$$, this number
    occurs in the array

    Thus, the condition is met and the array is integral.

    In the second test case it is enough to see that

    $$$\left \lfloor \frac{7}{3} \right \rfloor = \left \lfloor 2\frac{1}{3} \right
    \rfloor = 2$$$, this number is not in $$$a$$$, that''s why it is not integral.

    In the third test case $$$\left \lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right \rfloor = 1$$$, but
    there is only $$$2$$$ in the array, that''s why it is not integral.'

    British mathematician John Littlewood once said about Indian mathematician Srinivasa
    Ramanujan that "every positive integer was one of his personal friends."

    It turns out that positive integers can also be friends with each other! You are
    given an array $$$a$$$ of distinct positive integers.

    Define a

    subarray

    $$$a_i, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_j$$$ to be a

    friend group

    if and only if there exists an integer $$$m \ge 2$$$ such that $$$a_i \bmod m
    = a_{i+1} \bmod m = \ldots = a_j \bmod m$$$, where $$$x \bmod y$$$ denotes the
    remainder when $$$x$$$ is divided by $$$y$$$.

    Your friend Gregor wants to know the size of the largest friend group in $$$a$$$.

    Input

    Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
    test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4$$$).

    Each test case begins with a line containing the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le
    2 \cdot 10^5$$$), the size of the array $$$a$$$.

    The next line contains $$$n$$$ positive integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1
    \le a_i \le {10}^{18}$$$), representing the contents of the array $$$a$$$. It
    is guaranteed that all the numbers in $$$a$$$ are

    distinct

    .

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is less than $$$2\cdot
    10^5$$$.

    Output

    Your output should consist of $$$t$$$ lines. Each line should consist of a single
    integer, the size of the largest friend group in $$$a$$$.

    Polycarp often uses his smartphone. He has already installed $$$n$$$ applications
    on it. Application with number $$$i$$$ takes up $$$a_i$$$ units of memory.

    Polycarp wants to free at least $$$m$$$ units of memory (by removing some applications).

    Of course, some applications are more important to Polycarp than others. He came
    up with the following scoring system — he assigned an integer $$$b_i$$$ to each
    application:

    $$$b_i = 1$$$ — regular application;

    $$$b_i = 2$$$ — important application.

    According to this rating system, his phone has $$$b_1 + b_2 + \ldots + b_n$$$
    convenience points.

    Polycarp believes that if he removes applications with numbers $$$i_1, i_2, \ldots,
    i_k$$$, then he will free $$$a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + \ldots + a_{i_k}$$$ units of
    memory and lose $$$b_{i_1} + b_{i_2} + \ldots + b_{i_k}$$$ convenience points.

    For example, if $$$n=5$$$, $$$m=7$$$, $$$a=[5, 3, 2, 1, 4]$$$, $$$b=[2, 1, 1,
    2, 1]$$$, then Polycarp can uninstall the following application sets (not all
    options are listed below):

    applications with numbers $$$1, 4$$$ and $$$5$$$. In this case, it will free $$$a_1+a_4+a_5=10$$$
    units of memory and lose $$$b_1+b_4+b_5=5$$$ convenience points;

    applications with numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$3$$$. In this case, it will free $$$a_1+a_3=7$$$
    units of memory and lose $$$b_1+b_3=3$$$ convenience points.

    applications with numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$5$$$. In this case, it will free $$$a_2+a_5=7$$$
    memory units and lose $$$b_2+b_5=2$$$ convenience points.

    Help Polycarp, choose a set of applications, such that if removing them will free
    at least $$$m$$$ units of memory and lose the minimum number of convenience points,
    or indicate that such a set does not exist.

    Input

    The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number
    of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1
    \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1 \le m \le 10^9$$$) — the number of applications
    on Polycarp''s phone and the number of memory units to be freed.

    The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots,
    a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the number of memory units used by applications.

    The third line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots,
    b_n$$$ ($$$1 \le b_i \le 2$$$) — the convenience points of each application.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2

    There are $$$n$$$ cities and $$$m$$$ bidirectional roads in Berland. The $$$i$$$-th
    road connects the cities $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$, and has the speed limit $$$s_i$$$.
    The road network allows everyone to get from any city to any other city.

    The Berland Transport Ministry is planning a road reform.

    First of all, maintaining all $$$m$$$ roads is too costly, so $$$m - (n - 1)$$$
    roads will be demolished in such a way that the remaining $$$(n - 1)$$$ roads
    still allow to get to any city from any other city. Formally, the remaining roads
    should represent an undirected tree.

    Secondly, the speed limits on the remaining roads might be changed. The changes
    will be done sequentially, each change is either increasing the speed limit on
    some road by $$$1$$$, or decreasing it by $$$1$$$. Since changing the speed limit
    requires a lot of work, the Ministry wants to minimize the number of changes.

    The goal of the Ministry is to have a road network of $$$(n - 1)$$$ roads with
    the maximum speed limit over all roads equal to exactly $$$k$$$. They assigned
    you the task of calculating the minimum number of speed limit changes they have
    to perform so the road network meets their requirements.

    For example, suppose the initial map of Berland looks like that, and $$$k = 7$$$:

    Then one of the optimal courses of action is to demolish the roads $$$1$$$–$$$4$$$
    and $$$3$$$–$$$4$$$, and then decrease the speed limit on the road $$$2$$$–$$$3$$$
    by $$$1$$$, so the resulting road network looks like that:

    Input

    The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number
    of test cases.

    The first line of each test case contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and
    $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$n - 1 \le m \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5,
    \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$$$; $$$1 \le k \le 10^9$$$) — the number of cities, the number
    of roads and the required maximum speed limit, respectively.

    Then $$$m$$$ lines follow. The $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$x_i$$$,
    $$$y_i$$$ and $$$s_i$$$ ($$$1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$$$; $$$x_i \ne y_i$$$; $$$1 \le
    s_i \le 10^9$$$) — the cities connected by the $$$i$$$-th road and the speed limit
    on it, respectively. All roads are bidirectional.

    The road network in each test case is connected (that is, it is possible to reach
    any city from any other city by traveling along the road), and each pair of cities
    is connected by at most one road.

    The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$. Similarly,
    the sum of $$$m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of changes the Ministry
    has to perform so that the maximum speed limit among the remaining $$$(n - 1)$$$
    roads is exactly $$$k$$$.

    In the second test case, the road network initially looks like that:

    The Ministry can demolish the roads $$$1$$$–$$$2$$$, $$$3$$$–$$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$–$$$4$$$,
    and then increase the speed limit on the road $$$1$$$–$$$4$$$ three times.

    In the third test case, the road network already meets all the requirements.

    There are $$$n$$$ lamps with Spirit Tree''s light. Sein knows the time of turning
    on and off for the $$$i$$$-th lamp — $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ respectively. To

    happen that Sein may be wrong and there are no such $$$k$$$ lamps. The answer

    T and HL will take alternating turns, with T going first. In each turn, a player
    chooses a non-empty pile and then removes a single stone from it. However, one
    cannot choose a pile that has been chosen in the previous turn (the pile that
    was chosen by the other player, or if the current turn is the first turn then
    the player can choose any non-empty pile). The player who cannot choose a pile
    in his turn loses, and the game ends.

    Assuming both players play optimally, given the starting configuration of $$$t$$$
    games, determine the winner of each game.

    Input

    The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \le t \le
    100)$$$ — the number of games. The description of the games follows. Each description
    contains two lines:

    The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 100)$$$ — the
    number of piles.

    The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ $$$(1 \le
    a_i \le 100)$$$.

    Output

    For each game, print on a single line the name of the winner, "

    T

    " or "

    HL

    " (without quotes)

    After that, although the pile still contains $$$1$$$ stone, HL cannot choose from
    this pile because it has been chosen by T in the previous turn. Therefore, T is

    This is the hard version of the problem. The difference is the constraint on the
    sum of lengths of strings and the number of test cases. You can make hacks only
    if you solve all versions of this task.

    You are given a string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English letters. Find
    the longest string, $$$t$$$, which satisfies the following conditions:

    The length of $$$t$$$ does not exceed the length of $$$s$$$.

    $$$t$$$ is a palindrome.

    There exists two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ (possibly empty), such that $$$t
    = a + b$$$ ( "

    $$$+$$$

    " represents concatenation), and $$$a$$$ is prefix of $$$s$$$ while $$$b$$$ is
    suffix of $$$s$$$.

    Input

    The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
    $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^5$$$), the number of test cases. The next $$$t$$$
    lines each describe a test case.

    Each test case is a non-empty string $$$s$$$, consisting of lowercase English
    letters.

    It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not
    exceed $$$10^6$$$.

    Output

    For each test case, print the longest string which satisfies the conditions described
    above. If there exists multiple possible solutions, print any of them.

    In the first test, the string $$$s = $$$"

    a

    " satisfies all conditions.

    In the second test, the string "

    abcdfdcba

    " satisfies all conditions, because:

    Its length is $$$9$$$, which does not exceed the length of the string $$$s$$$,

    There are $$$m$$$ people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let $$$y_1, y_2, \dots,

    As you might already know, space has always been a problem in ICPC Jakarta. To
    cope with this, ICPC Jakarta is planning to build

    two

    new buildings. These buildings should have a shape of a rectangle of the same
    size. Now, their problem is to find land to build the buildings.

    There are $$$N$$$ lands available for sale. The $$$i^{th}$$$ land has a rectangular
    shape of size $$$L_i \times W_i$$$. For a good feng shui, the building''s side
    should be parallel to the land''s sides.

    One way is to build the two buildings on two different lands, one on each land
    (not necessarily with the same orientation). A building of size $$$A \times B$$$
    can be build on the $$$i^{th}$$$ land if and only if at least one of the following
    is satisfied:

    $$$A \le L_i$$$ and $$$B \le W_i$$$, or

    $$$A \le W_i$$$ and $$$B \le L_i$$$.

    Alternatively, it is also possible to build two buildings of $$$A \times B$$$
    on the $$$i^{th}$$$ land with the same orientation. Formally, it is possible to
    build two buildings of $$$A \times B$$$ on the $$$i^{th}$$$ land if and only if
    at least one of the following is satisfied:

    $$$A \times 2 \le L_i$$$ and $$$B \le W_i$$$, or

    $$$A \times 2 \le W_i$$$ and $$$B \le L_i$$$, or

    $$$A \le L_i$$$ and $$$B \times 2 \le W_i$$$, or

    $$$A \le W_i$$$ and $$$B \times 2 \le L_i$$$.

    Your task in this problem is to help ICPC Jakarta to figure out the largest possible
    buildings they can build given $$$N$$$ available lands. Note that ICPC Jakarta
    has to build two buildings of $$$A \times B$$$; output the largest possible for
    $$$A \times B$$$.

    Input

    Input begins with a line containing an integer: $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \le N \le 100\,000$$$)
    representing the number of available lands. The next $$$N$$$ lines each contains

    Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time problem
    is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this
    way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and then
    $$$3n$$$ times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex
    envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come
    up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation
    just like Petr but swaps elements $$$7n+1$$$ times instead of $$$3n$$$ times.
    Because it is more random, OK?!

    You somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from
    which one.

    Input

    In the first line of input there is one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$10^{3} \le n \le 10^{6}$$$).

    In the second line there are $$$n$$$ distinct integers between $$$1$$$ and $$$n$$$ —
    the permutation of size $$$n$$$ from the test.

    It is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First
    we choose $$$n$$$ — the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method
    to generate a permutation — the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate
    a permutation using chosen method.

    Output

    If the test is generated via Petr''s method print "

    Petr

    After the big birthday party, Katie still wanted Shiro to have some more fun.
    Later, she came up with a game called

    treasure hunt

    . Of course, she invited her best friends Kuro and Shiro to play with her.

    The three friends are very smart so they passed all the challenges very quickly
    and finally reached the destination. But the treasure can only belong to one cat
    so they started to think of something which can determine who is worthy of the
    treasure. Instantly, Kuro came up with some ribbons.

    A random colorful ribbon is given to each of the cats. Each color of the ribbon
    can be represented as an uppercase or lowercase Latin letter. Let''s call a consecutive
    subsequence of colors that appears in the ribbon a

    subribbon

    . The

    beauty

    of a ribbon is defined as the maximum number of times one of its subribbon appears
    in the ribbon. The more the subribbon appears, the more beautiful is the ribbon.
    For example, the ribbon

    aaaaaaa

    has the beauty of $$$7$$$ because its subribbon

    a

    appears $$$7$$$ times, and the ribbon

    abcdabc

    has the beauty of $$$2$$$ because its subribbon

    abc

    appears twice.

    The rules are simple. The game will have $$$n$$$ turns. Every turn, each of the
    cats must change strictly

    one

    color (at one position) in his/her ribbon to an arbitrary color which is

    different

    from the unchanged one. For example, a ribbon

    aaab

    can be changed into

    acab

    in one turn. The one having the most beautiful ribbon after $$$n$$$ turns wins
    the treasure.

    Could you find out who is going to be the winner if they all play optimally?

    Input

    The first line contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$0 \leq n \leq 10^{9}$$$) — the
    number of turns.

    Next 3 lines contain 3 ribbons of Kuro, Shiro and Katie one per line, respectively.
    Each ribbon is a string which contains no more than $$$10^{5}$$$ uppercase and
    lowercase Latin letters and is not empty. It is guaranteed that the length of
    all ribbons are equal for the purpose of fairness. Note that uppercase and lowercase
    letters are considered different colors.

    Output

    Print the name of the winner ("

    Kuro

    ", "

    Shiro

    " or "

    Katie

    "). If there are at least two cats that share the maximum beauty, print "

    In the first example, after $$$3$$$ turns, Kuro can change his ribbon into

    ooooo

    , which has the beauty of $$$5$$$, while reaching such beauty for Shiro and Katie
    is impossible (both Shiro and Katie can reach the beauty of at most $$$4$$$, for
    example by changing Shiro''s ribbon into

    SSiSS

    and changing Katie''s ribbon into

    Kaaaa

    ). Therefore, the winner is Kuro.

    In the fourth example, since the length of each of the string is $$$9$$$ and the
    number of turn is $$$15$$$, everyone can change their ribbons in some way to reach
    the maximal beauty of $$$9$$$ by changing their strings into

    zzzzzzzzz

    after 9 turns, and repeatedly change their strings into

    azzzzzzzz

    and then into

    zzzzzzzzz

    thrice. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.'

    Merge sort is a well-known sorting algorithm. The main function that sorts the
    elements of array

    a

    with indices from

    [

    l

    ,

    r

    )

    can be implemented as follows:

    If the segment

    [

    l

    ,

    r

    )

    is already sorted in non-descending order (that is, for any

    i

    such that

    l

    ≤

    a

    [

    i

    ] ≤

    a

    [

    + 1]

    ), then end the function call;

    Let

    ;

    ,

    l

    ,

    mid

    )

    (

    ;

    Merge segments

    [

    l

    ,

    mid

    )

    and

    [

    mid

    ,

    r

    )

    , making the segment

    [

    l

    ,

    r

    )

    sorted in non-descending order. The merge algorithm doesn''t call any other functions.

    The array in this problem is

    0

    -indexed, so to sort the whole array, you need to call

    mergesort

    (

    a

    , 0,

    n

    )

    .

    The number of calls of function

    mergesort

    is very important, so Ivan has decided to calculate it while sorting the array.
    For example, if

    a

    = {1, 2, 3, 4}

    , then there will be

    1

    call of

    mergesort

    —

    mergesort

    (0, 4)

    , which will check that the array is sorted and then end. If

    a

    = {2, 1, 3}

    , then the number of calls is

    3

    : first of all, you call

    mergesort

    (0, 3)

    , which then sets

    mid

    = 1

    and calls

    mergesort

    (0, 1)

    and

    mergesort

    (1, 3)

    , which do not perform any recursive calls because segments

    (0, 1)

    and

    (1, 3)

    are sorted.

    Ivan has implemented the program that counts the number of

    mergesort

    calls, but now he needs to test it. To do this, he needs to find an array

    a

    such that

    a

    is a permutation of size

    n

    (that is, the number of elements in

    a

    is

    n

    , and every integer number from

    [1,

    n

    ]

    can be found in this array), and the number of

    mergesort

    calls when sorting the array is exactly

    k

    .

    Help Ivan to find an array he wants!

    Input

    The first line contains two numbers

    n

    and

    k

    (

    1 ≤

    n

    ≤ 100000

    ,

    1 ≤

    k

    ≤ 200000

    ) — the size of a desired permutation and the number of

    mergesort

    calls required to sort it.

    Output

    If a permutation of size

    n

    such that there will be exactly

    k

    calls of

    mergesort

    while sorting it doesn''t exist, output

    This is an interactive problem. You have to use

    operation right after printing each line. For example, in C++ you should use function

    , in Java —

    System.out.flush()

    , in Pascal —

    flush(output)

    and in Python —

    sys.stdout.flush()

    .

    In this problem, you need to find maximal and minimal elements of an array. What
    could be simpler?

    You can imagine that the jury has an array, and initially you know the only number

    n

    — array''s length.

    Array''s elements are numbered from

    1

    to

    n

    . You are allowed to compare two elements of the array by using their indices

    i

    and

    j

    . There are three possible responses to this query: ''

    <

    '' (if

    a

    i

    is less than

    a

    j

    ), ''

    =

    '' (if

    a

    i

    is equal to

    a

    j

    ) and finally ''

    >

    '' (if

    a

    i

    is greater than

    a

    j

    ).

    It''s known that it''s always possible to find both maximal and minimal elements
    of the array by using no more than

    comparisons, where

    ⌈

    x

    ⌉

    is the result of rounding

    x

    up.

    Write the program that will find positions of the minimum and the maximum in the
    jury''s array of length

    n

    , by using no more than

    f

    (

    n

    )

    comparisons.

    Interaction

    Each test for this problem will contain one or more arrays. You have to find positions
    of minimal and maximal elements for each of these arrays. The first line of the
    input contains integer

    T

    (

    1 ≤

    T

    ≤ 1000

    ) — number of arrays in the test.

    Thus, at the beginning, you program should read number

    T

    , and then it should solve the problem for

    T

    jury''s arrays one by one.

    Then input for each array goes. Firstly, your program has to read the number

    n

    (

    1 ≤

    n

    ≤ 50

    ) — the length of the array. It will be provided in the next line of the input.

    Further, your program can perform comparisons or report that the answer is found.

    To perform a comparison, you have to output string of the following pattern «

    ? i j

    » (

    i

    and

    j

    must be integer numbers from

    1

    to

    n

    ) — the indices of the elements to compare in the current query.

    To report the indices of minimal and maximal elements of the hidden array, your
    program have to output a line in the form «

    ! i j

    » (

    i

    and

    j

    must be integer numbers from

    1

    to

    n

    ), where

    i

    is an index of the minimal element of array, and

    j

    is an index of the maximal element of the array. If there are several possible
    answers to the problem, you can output any of them.

    There are several possible responses for a comparison:

    ''

    <

    '' — if

    a

    i

    is less than

    a

    j

    ,

    ''

    =

    '' — if

    a

    i

    is equal to

    a

    ,

    ''

    >

    '' — if

    a

    i

    is greater than

    a

    j

    .

    For an array of length

    n

    your program can make at most

    comparisons. Note that the operation of reporting an answer («

    ! i j

    » ) is not included into the value of

    f

    (

    n

    )

    .

    After the answer is reported, your program has to solve the problem for the next
    array or it should terminate if all

    T

    arrays are processed.

    Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task
    description.

    You are given

    q

    queries and a multiset

    A

    , initially containing only integer

    0

    . There are three types of queries:

    "

    + x

    " — add integer

    x

    to multiset

    A

    .

    "

    - x

    " — erase one occurrence of integer

    x

    from multiset

    A

    . It''s guaranteed that at least one

    x

    is present in the multiset

    A

    before this query.

    "

    ? x

    " — you are given integer

    x

    and need to compute the value

    , i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer

    x

    and some integer

    y

    from the multiset

    A

    .

    Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.

    Input

    The first line of the input contains a single integer

    q

    (

    1 ≤

    q

    ≤ 200 000

    ) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.

    Each of the following

    q

    lines of the input contains one of three characters ''

    +

    '', ''

    -

    '' or ''

    ?

    '' and an integer

    x

    i

    (

    1 ≤

    x

    i

    ≤ 10

    9

    ). It''s guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.

    Note, that the integer

    0

    will always be present in the set

    A

    .

    Output

    For each query of the type ''

    ?

    '' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer

    x

    i

    and some integer from the multiset

    A

    .

    To confuse the opponents, the Galactic Empire represents fractions in an unusual

    PMP is getting a warrior. He is practicing a lot, but the results are not acceptable
    yet. This time instead of programming contests, he decided to compete in a car
    racing to increase the spirit of victory. He decides to choose a competition that
    also exhibits algorithmic features.

    AlgoRace is a special league of car racing where different teams compete in a
    country of

    n

    cities. Cities are numbered

    1

    through

    n

    . Every two distinct cities in the country are connected with one bidirectional
    road. Each competing team should introduce one driver and a set of cars.

    The competition is held in

    r

    rounds. In

    i

    -th round, drivers will start at city

    s

    i

    and finish at city

    t

    i

    . Drivers are allowed to change their cars at most

    k

    i

    times. Changing cars can take place in any city in no time. One car can be used
    multiple times in one round, but total number of changes should not exceed

    k

    i

    . Drivers can freely choose their path to destination.

    PMP has prepared

    m

    type of purpose-built cars. Beside for PMP’s driving skills, depending on properties
    of the car and the road, a car traverses each road in each direction in different
    times.

    PMP Warriors wants to devise best strategies of choosing car and roads in each
    round to maximize the chance of winning the cup. For each round they want to find
    the minimum time required to finish it.

    to come to an amicable agreement, so they decide to leave this up to chance.

    They take turns drawing a mouse from a bag which initially contains

    w

    white and

    b

    black mice. The person who is the first to draw a white mouse wins. After each
    mouse drawn by the dragon the rest of mice in the bag panic, and one of them jumps
    out of the bag itself (the princess draws her mice carefully and doesn''t scare
    other mice).

    Princess draws first.

    What is the probability of the princess winning?

    If there are no more mice in the bag and nobody has drawn a white mouse, the dragon
    wins. Mice which jump out of the bag themselves are not considered to be drawn
    (do not define the winner). Once a mouse has left the bag, it never returns to

    Every year a race takes place on the motorway between cities A and B. This year
    Vanya decided to take part in the race and drive his own car that has been around
    and bears its own noble name — The Huff-puffer.

    So, Vasya leaves city A on the Huff-puffer, besides, at the very beginning he
    fills the petrol tank with

    α

    liters of petrol (

    α ≥ 10

    is Vanya''s favorite number, it is not necessarily integer). Petrol stations are
    located on the motorway at an interval of

    100

    kilometers, i.e. the first station is located

    100

    kilometers away from the city A, the second one is

    200

    kilometers away from the city A, the third one is

    300

    kilometers away from the city A and so on. The Huff-puffer spends

    10

    liters of petrol every

    100

    kilometers.

    Vanya checks the petrol tank every time he passes by a petrol station. If the
    petrol left in the tank is not enough to get to the next station, Vanya fills
    the tank with

    α

    liters of petrol. Otherwise, he doesn''t stop at the station and drives on.

    For example, if

    α = 43.21

    , then the car will be fuelled up for the first time at the station number

    4

    , when there''ll be

    3.21

    petrol liters left. After the fuelling up the car will have

    46.42

    liters. Then Vanya stops at the station number

    8

    and ends up with

    6.42 + 43.21 = 49.63

    liters. The next stop is at the station number

    12

    ,

    9.63 + 43.21 = 52.84

    . The next stop is at the station number

    17

    and so on.

    You won''t believe this but the Huff-puffer has been leading in the race! Perhaps
    it is due to unexpected snow. Perhaps it is due to video cameras that have been
    installed along the motorway which register speed limit breaking. Perhaps it is
    due to the fact that Vanya threatened to junk the Huff-puffer unless the car wins.
    Whatever the reason is, the Huff-puffer is leading, and jealous people together
    with other contestants wrack their brains trying to think of a way to stop that
    outrage.

    One way to do this is to mine the next petrol station where Vanya will stop. Your
    task is to calculate at which station this will happen and warn Vanya. You don''t
    know the

    α

    number, however, you are given the succession of the numbers of the stations where
    Vanya has stopped. Find the number of the station where the next stop will be.

    Input

    The first line contains an integer

    n

    (

    1 ≤

    n

    ≤ 1000

    ) which represents the number of petrol stations where Vanya has stopped. The
    next line has

    n

    space-separated integers which represent the numbers of the stations. The numbers
    are positive and do not exceed

    10

    6

    , they are given in the increasing order. No two numbers in the succession match.
    It is guaranteed that there exists at least one number

    α ≥ 10

    , to which such a succession of stops corresponds.

    Output

    Print in the first line "unique" (without quotes) if the answer can be determined
    uniquely. In the second line print the number of the station where the next stop
    will take place. If the answer is not unique, print in the first line "not unique".

    , we''ll have such a sequence as

    1

    ,

    2

    Learn, learn and learn again — Valera has to do this every day. He is studying
    at mathematical school, where math is the main discipline. The mathematics teacher
    loves her discipline very much and tries to cultivate this love in children. That''s
    why she always gives her students large and difficult homework. Despite that Valera
    is one of the best students, he failed to manage with the new homework. That''s
    why he asks for your help. He has the following task. A sequence of

    n

    numbers is given. A prefix of a sequence is the part of the sequence (possibly
    empty), taken from the start of the sequence. A suffix of a sequence is the part
    of the sequence (possibly empty), taken from the end of the sequence. It is allowed
    to sequentially make two operations with the sequence. The first operation is
    to take some prefix of the sequence and multiply all numbers in this prefix by

    - 1

    . The second operation is to take some suffix and multiply all numbers in it by

    - 1

    . The chosen prefix and suffix may intersect. What is the maximum total sum of
    the sequence that can be obtained by applying the described operations?

    Input

    The first line contains integer

    n

    (

    1 ≤

    n

    ≤ 10

    5

    ) — amount of elements in the sequence. The second line contains
