Yes, the image provided shows the full problem statement and all necessary details for solving the problem "C3. Hacking Numbers (Hard Version)" from Codeforces Round 1025 (Div. 2).

### Problem Deconstruction

**Constraints:**
*   `1 <= t <= 5000` (Number of test cases)
*   `1 <= n <= 10^9` (Target integer)
*   The initial unknown integer `x` is in the range `1 <= x <= 10^9`.
*   The intermediate value of `x` after a successful operation must be in the range `[1, 10^18]`.
*   **`add y`**: `-10^18 <= y <= 10^18`
*   **`mul y`**: `1 <= y <= 10^18`
*   **`div y`**: `1 <= y <= 10^18`

**Input Format:**
*   The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
*   Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n`, the target value for that test case.

**Interaction Format:**
This is an interactive problem.
*   For each test case, your program first reads `n`.
*   To perform an operation, your program must print the command to standard output, followed by a newline, and then flush the output buffer. For example: `add 10`.
*   After each command, your program must read a single integer from standard input, which will be "1" for a successful operation or "0" for a failed one.
*   The goal is to output a sequence of commands that transforms the unknown initial integer `x` into `n`, using the minimum possible number of commands for a worst-case `x` (`f(n)`).

**Examples:**
No full interaction examples are provided in the problem statement, which is common for interactive problems. An example for the `S(n)` function is given: `S(123) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

### Solution Approach

The core challenge is to find a sequence of commands that transforms *any* possible starting value of `x` (from `1` to `10^9`) into a specific target `n`. This sequence must be universal, as we don't know the initial `x`. The length of this sequence should be minimized.

The most powerful command for reducing uncertainty is `"digit"`, which replaces `x` with the sum of its digits, `S(x)`.

1.  **Reaching a Known Small Range:**
    Any integer `x` in `[1, 10^9]` has a digit sum `S(x)` at most `S(999,999,999) = 81`.
    *   After one `"digit"` command, `x` is guaranteed to be in the range `[1, 81]`.
    *   Applying `"digit"` again: the maximum value is now 81, so the new maximum `S(x)` is `S(79) = 16`. `x` is now in `[1, 16]`.
    *   A third `"digit"` command: the maximum value is now 16, so the new maximum `S(x)` is `S(9) = 9`. `x` is now in `[1, 9]`.
    Therefore, after three consecutive `"digit"` commands, the unknown number `x` is guaranteed to be a single-digit integer from 1 to 9.

2.  **Reaching a Fixed Number:**
    After three `"digit"` commands, we have an unknown `x_3 \in \{1, 2, ..., 9\}`. We need a way to transform any of these 9 possibilities into a single, known number.
    A useful number-theoretic property is `S(i * (10^k - 1)) = 9k` for any integer `i \in [1, 9]` and `k \ge 1`. For example, `S(3 * 99) = S(297) = 18 = 9*2`, and `S(7 * 999) = S(6993) = 27 = 9*3`.
    We can use this property.
    *   Let's take `k=1`. The multiplier is `10^1 - 1 = 9`.
    *   After 3 `"digit"` commands, `x` is some `x_3 \in [1,9]`.
    *   Command 4: `mul 9`. `x` becomes `x_3 * 9`. The possible values are `{9, 18, 27, ..., 81}`.
    *   Command 5: `digit`. The sum of digits of any number in `{9, 18, ..., 81}` is always 9. So, `x` is now deterministically 9.

    This gives us a 5-command sequence to guarantee that `x` becomes 9: `digit`, `digit`, `digit`, `mul 9`, `digit`.

3.  **Reaching the Target `n`:**
    Once `x` is a known value (9), we can easily transform it to any target `n`.
    *   If `n=9`, we are done in 5 commands.
    *   If `n \neq 9`, we can use one more command: `add (n-9)`. This changes `x` from 9 to `9 + (n-9) = n`. This takes a total of 6 commands.

4.  **An Optimization (The `f(n)=5` case):**
    Can we do better? The sequence above gives `f(9)=5` and `f(n)=6` for `n \neq 9`.
    Let's revisit the property `S(i * (10^k - 1)) = 9k`. If our target `n` can be expressed as `9k`, we can reach it in 5 steps directly.
    *   We need `n = 9k`, so `k = n/9`.
    *   The command would be `mul (10^{n/9} - 1)`.
    *   The multiplier `y = 10^{n/9} - 1` must be `1 <= y <= 10^{18}`. This implies `1 \le n/9 \le 18`, which means `9 \le n \le 162`.
    *   So, if `n` is a multiple of 9 and `9 \le n \le 162`, we can use the sequence: `digit`, `digit`, `digit`, `mul (10^{n/9}-1)`, `digit`. This takes 5 commands.

    It can be shown that a universal sequence of 4 commands is not possible. Thus, `f(n) \ge 5`. This means our 5-command solutions are optimal. For all other `n`, our 6-command solution is also optimal.

**Final Strategy:**
*   If `n` is a multiple of 9 and `9 \le n \le 162`: Use the 5-command sequence with `mul (10^{n/9}-1)`.
*   Otherwise: Use the 6-command sequence (or 5 if `n=9`, which is covered by the first case) to first get 9, then use `add (n-9)` to get `n`.
