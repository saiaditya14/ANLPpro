### Extracted Information

**Problem:** We are given `2n` distinct, sorted timestamps `a_1, ..., a_{2n}` which represent either an entry or an exit of a visitor from a museum. We need to assign `n` of these as entries and `n` as exits. The goal is to maximize the total stay time of all visitors, subject to a capacity constraint: for each `k` from 1 to `n`, we must find this maximum total stay time assuming at most `k` people can be in the museum at any given moment.

**Constraints:**
- Number of test cases `t`: `1 <= t <= 10^4`
- Number of visitor pairs `n`: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
- Timestamps `a_i`: `1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{2n} <= 10^9`
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

**Input Format:**
- The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines:
    - The first line contains an integer `n`.
    - The second line contains `2n` space-separated integers `a_1, ..., a_{2n}`.

**Output Format:**
- For each test case, print `n` space-separated integers. The `i`-th integer (for `i` from 1 to `n`) should be the maximum possible total stay time for a capacity of `k=i`.

### Solution Approach

The total stay time can be expressed as `Sum(exit_times) - Sum(entry_times)`. To maximize this, we should choose the largest timestamps as exits and the smallest as entries.

Let's start by considering the case with the maximum possible capacity, `k=n`. With this capacity, there's effectively no restriction on how many people can be inside, as long as the entries and exits are paired correctly. The optimal strategy is to assign the first `n` timestamps `{a_1, ..., a_n}` as entries and the last `n` timestamps `{a_{n+1}, ..., a_{2n}}` as exits. This maximizes `Sum(exits) - Sum(entries)` and is a valid assignment for `k=n` people (the number of people inside will increase to `n` and then decrease back to 0). The maximum stay for `k=n` is `(a_{n+1} + ... + a_{2n}) - (a_1 + ... + a_n)`.

Now, how do we find the answer for `k=n-1`? The previous assignment is no longer valid as it reaches a peak of `n` people. To satisfy the new capacity of `n-1`, we must alter our choice of entries and exits. The number of people inside is the number of entries minus exits up to a certain time. By swapping one entry time `e` with one exit time `x` (where `e < x`), we decrease the number of people inside by 2 for the entire duration between `e` and `x`. This modification can reduce the peak occupancy.

To go from a solution for capacity `k` to `k-1`, we need to perform one such swap. To minimize the reduction in the total stay time, we should choose an entry `e` and an exit `x` such that the difference `x - e` is as small as possible. The reduction in total stay time will be `2 * (x - e)`.

This suggests a greedy approach:
1.  Calculate the answer for `k=n` as described above. Let's call the set of entry times `E` and exit times `X`. Initially, `E = {a_1, ..., a_n}` and `X = {a_{n+1}, ..., a_{2n}}`.
2.  To find the answer for `k=n-1`, we find the pair `(e, x)` with `e \in E` and `x \in X` that has the minimum difference `x - e`. We then swap them: `e` becomes an exit and `x` becomes an entry. The new total stay is the previous total stay minus `2 * (x - e)`.
3.  We repeat this process. To find the answer for `k-2`, we find the best pair to swap from the updated sets `E` and `X`, and so on, until we have the answer for `k=1`.

To efficiently find the minimum difference `x-e` at each step, we can observe that the best candidates for `(e, x)` must be adjacent in the sorted list of all `2n` timestamps.
We can maintain a min-priority queue of differences between all adjacent `a_i, a_{i+1}` that belong to different sets (`E` and `X`).

The overall algorithm is as follows:
1.  Initialize `E = {a_1, ..., a_n}` and `X = {a_{n+1}, ..., a_{2n}}`. Calculate and store the answer for `k=n`.
2.  Create a min-priority queue. Initially, it contains only one element: the difference `a_{n+1} - a_n` corresponding to the boundary between `E` and `X`.
3.  Iterate `k` from `n-1` down to `1`:
    a. Extract the minimum difference `d = a_{i+1} - a_i` from the priority queue.
    b. The answer for `k` is `ans[k+1] - 2*d`. Store it.
    c. Swap the set assignments for `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`.
    d. This removes the boundary between `a_i, a_{i+1}`. Check for new boundaries that may have formed with their neighbors (`a_{i-1}, a_i` and `a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}`) and add their differences to the priority queue if applicable. Also, any old boundaries involving these neighbors might be removed. A lazy update mechanism with an `active` flag array for PQ entries is suitable here.
4.  Finally, print the computed answers for `k=1, ..., n`.

This approach has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` per test case, which is efficient enough given the constraints.
