### Problem Extraction

*   **Objective:** Find the minimum total cost for Leo to travel from behind the last cyclist (`n`) to in front of the first cyclist (`1`).

*   **State:** Leo's position on the road and the current agility values `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` of the cyclists at each position.

*   **Process:** Leo starts behind cyclist `n`. To reach the front, he must overtake cyclists in the order `n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.

*   **Actions & Costs:**
    1.  **Overtake:** When Leo is immediately behind the cyclist at position `i`, he can overtake them. The cost of this action is `a_i`, the agility value of the cyclist at that position at that moment.
    2.  **Swap:** At any time, Leo can swap the agility values of the cyclists at positions `i` and `j` (where `1 <= i < j <= n`). The cost of this action is `j-i`.

*   **Constraints:**
    *   Number of test cases `t`: `1 <= t <= 10^3`
    *   Number of cyclists `n`: `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^3`
    *   Agility values `a_i`: `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`
    *   The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `5 * 10^3`.

*   **Input Format:**
    *   The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
    *   Each test case consists of two lines:
        *   The first line contains an integer `n`.
        *   The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

*   **Output Format:**
    *   For each test case, print a single integer representing the minimum total cost.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Input:**
        ```
        4

        1 2 4

        100 1
        5
        5 4 3 2 1
        ```

### Solution Approach

The problem asks for the minimum cost to get from behind cyclist `n` to in front of cyclist `1`. This involves a sequence of `n` overtakes, for positions `k = n, n-1, ..., 1`.

Let's analyze the process step-by-step. Suppose Leo is about to overtake the cyclist at position `k`. The cyclists at positions `1, 2, ..., k` are still ahead of him. To minimize the cost of this specific overtake, he can choose to pay the agility `a_k` of the cyclist currently at position `k`, or he can swap another cyclist from a position `j < k` into position `k`.

If he chooses a cyclist from position `j` (where `1 <= j <= k`), he first incurs a swap cost. To bring the cyclist from position `j` to `k`, he can perform a single swap between positions `j` and `k`. The cost of this swap is `k-j`. After the swap, the cyclist who was at `j` is now at `k`, and their agility value is the cost of the overtake.

So, for the step of overtaking the cyclist at position `k`, Leo has `k` options: for each `j` from `1` to `k`, he can move the cyclist from position `j` to `k` and then overtake them. The total cost for this step, if he chooses cyclist `j`, would be:
`Cost for step k (choosing j) = (swap cost) + (overtake cost) = (k - j) + a_j`
where `a_j` is the agility value at position `j` at that moment. Note that if `j=k`, the swap cost is `k-k=0`, so the cost is just `a_k`.

To minimize the total cost, it's optimal to make a locally optimal (greedy) choice at each step. When at position `k`, he should choose the `j` (`1 <= j <= k`) that minimizes `a_j + k - j`. This decision determines the cost for step `k`.

After this choice, the agility array is updated. The cyclist chosen from position `j` is now considered "overtaken", and the cyclist who was at `k` is now at position `j`. This is effectively a swap of agility values between positions `j` and `k`. This updated array is then used for the next step (`k-1`).

This leads to the following greedy algorithm:
1.  Initialize `total_cost = 0`.
2.  Iterate `k` from `n` down to `1`. In each iteration, we decide the minimum cost to pass the cyclist at position `k`.
3.  For the current `k`, find the index `j` (`1 <= j <= k`) that minimizes the expression `a_j + k - j`, where `a` is the current array of agilities.
4.  Add this minimum cost to `total_cost`.
5.  Update the array by swapping the agility values at positions `j` and `k` to reflect the change for subsequent steps.

This algorithm has a nested loop structure. The outer loop runs `n` times (for `k`), and the inner loop runs `k` times (for `j`). This results in an overall time complexity of O(N^2) per test case, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.

    // We iterate k from n down to 1, representing the position Leo is about to clear.

        // At step k, Leo can choose to bring any cyclist from an available position j (1 <= j <= k)
        // to position k to overtake. The available cyclists are those at indices 0 to k-1.

            int current_j_idx = j - 1;

            // The cost for choosing the cyclist at position j consists of two parts:
            // 1. Swap cost: to bring the cyclist from position j to k, which is (k-j).
            // 2. Overtake cost: the agility value of that cyclist, a[current_j_idx].
            long long current_step_cost = a[current_j_idx] + (k - j);

        // After making the decision, the state of the agilities array changes.
        // The cyclist with agility a[best_j_idx] is now "consumed" (overtaken).
        // The cyclist who was at position k is now at the position that the chosen cyclist came from.
        // This is equivalent to swapping the agilities at index best_j_idx and current_k_idx.
        // This updates the array for the next iteration (k-1).
